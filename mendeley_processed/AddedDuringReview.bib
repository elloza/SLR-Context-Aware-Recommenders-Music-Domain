abstract = {With the rapid expansion of digital music formats, it's indispensable to recommend users with their favorite music. For music recommendation, users' personality and emotion greatly affect their music preference, respectively in a long-term and short-term manner, while rich social media data provides effective feedback on these information. In this paper, aiming at music recommendation on social media platforms, we propose a Personality and Emotion Integrated Attentive model (PEIA), which fully utilizes social media data to comprehensively model users' long-term taste (personality) and short-term preference (emotion). Specifically, it takes full advantage of personality-oriented user features, emotion-oriented user features and music features of multi-faceted attributes. Hierarchical attention is employed to distinguish the important factors when incorporating the latent representations of users' personality and emotion. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset of 171,254 users demonstrate the effectiveness of our PEIA model which achieves an NDCG of 0.5369, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. We also perform detailed parameter analysis and feature contribution analysis, which further verify our scheme and demonstrate the significance of co-modeling of user personality and emotion in music recommendation.},

abstract = {Context aware recommender system has become an area of rigorous research attributing to incorporate context features, thereby increases accuracy while making recommendations. Most of the researches have proved neighborhood based collaborative filtering to be one of the most efficient mechanisms in recommender systems because of its simplicity, intuitiveness and wide usage in commercial domains. However, the basic challenges observed in this area include sparsity of data, scalability and utilization of contexts effectively. In this study, a novel framework is proposed to generate recommendations independently of the count and type of context dimensions, hence pertinent for real life recommender systems. In the framework, we have used k-prototype clustering technique to group contextually similar users to get a reduced and effective set. Additionally, particle swarm optimization technique is applied on the closest cluster to find the contribution of different context features to control data sparsity problem. Also, the proposed framework employs an improved similarity measure which considers contextual condition of the user. The results came from the series of experiments using two context enriched datasets showcasing that the proposed framework increases the accuracy of recommendations over other techniques from the same domain without consuming extra cost in terms of time.},

abstract = {Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) take contextual conditions into account when providing item recommendations. In recent years, context-aware matrix factorization (CAMF) has emerged as an extension of the matrix factorization technique that also incorporates contextual conditions. In this paper, we introduce another matrix factorization approach for contextual recommendations, the contextual SLIM (CSLIM) recommendation approach. It is derived from the sparse linear method (SLIM) which was designed for Top-N recommendations in traditional recommender systems. Based on the experimental evaluations over several context-aware data sets, we demonstrate that CLSIM can be an effective approach for context-aware recommendations, in many cases outperforming state-of-the-art CARS algorithms in the Top- N recommendation task.},

abstract = {Recommender systems often generate recommendations based on user's prior preferences. Users' preferences may change over time due to user mode change or context change, identification of such a change is important for generating personalized recommendations. Many earlier methods have been developed under the assumption that each user has a fixed pattern. Regardless of these changes, the recommendation may not match the user's personal preference and this recommendation will not be useful to the user based on the current context of the user. Context-aware recommender systems deal with this problem by utilizing contextual information that affects user preferences and states. Using contextual information is challenging because it is not always possible to obtain all the contextual information. Also, adding various types of contexts to recommender systems increases its dimensionality and sparsity. This paper presents a novel hierarchical hidden Markov model to identify changes in user's preferences over time by modeling the latent context of users. Using the user-selected items, the proposed method models the user as a hidden Markov process and considers the current context of the user as a hidden variable. The latent contexts are automatically learned for each user utilizing hidden Markov model on the data collected from the user's feedback sequences. The results of the experiments, on the benchmark data sets, show that the proposed model has a better performance compared to other methods.},

abstract = {In Recommender Systems, the techniques used for modeling implicit feedback such as search, click or purchase actions have been well studied. As additional information, contexts are often available to assist the implicit feedback approaches. The existing context-aware methods are used to directly model original contextual factors for recommendations. However, this way of utilizing contextual information makes the methods dependent on specific contexts. Moreover, they may not achieve the desired performance if the contexts are changed to those derived from other domains. To address this issue, we propose a general approach to incorporate contexts into an implicit feedback modeling framework that can utilize specific contexts but is domain independent. First, we introduce context neighbors to integrate original contextual factors. The neighbors are aggregated to form several groups. Then, our recommender builds on group interactions that expand the traditional user-item interactions. Finally, the recommendations are obtained by combining the results of all the interaction models. We evaluate the Context Neighbor Recommender (CNR) for different choices of neighbor numbers and kernel settings to further compare it with other algorithms. The experimental results show the advantages and flexibility of CNR compared to both implicit feedback methods and common context-aware models.},

abstract = {Recommender systems aim to identify relevant items for particular users in large-scale online applications. The historical rating data of users is a valuable input resource for many recommendation models such as collaborative filtering (CF), but these models are known to suffer from the rating sparsity problem when the users or items under consideration have insufficient rating records. With the continued growth of online social networks, the increased user-to-user relationships are reported to be helpful and can alleviate the CF rating sparsity problem. Although researchers have developed a range of social network-based recommender systems, there is no unified model to handle multirelational social networks. To address this challenge, this paper represents different user relationships in a multigraph and develops a multigraph ranking model to identify and recommend the nearest neighbors of particular users in high-order environments. We conduct empirical experiments on two real-world datasets: 1) Epinions and 2) Last.fm, and the comprehensive comparison with other approaches demonstrates that our model improves recommendation performance in terms of both recommendation coverage and accuracy, especially when the rating data are sparse.},

The contributions of this paper are four-fold: (1) We elaborate how social network information can benefit recommender systems; (2) We interpret the differences between social-based recommender systems and trust-aware recommender systems; (3) We coin the term Social Regularization to represent the social constraints on recommender systems, and we systematically illustrate how to design a matrix factorization objective function with social regularization; and (4) The proposed method is quite general, which can be easily extended to incorporate other contextual information, like social tags, etc. The empirical analysis on two large datasets demonstrates that our approaches outperform other state-of-the-art methods.

abstract = {Recommender Systems have been applied in a large number of domains. However, current approaches rarely consider multiple criteria or the level of mobility and location of a user. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm to construct personalized multi-criteria Recommender Systems. Our algorithm incorporates the user's current context, and techniques from the Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis field of study to model user preferences. The obtained preference model is used to assess the utility of each item, to then recommend the items with the highest utility. The criteria considered when creating preference models are the user location, mobility level and user profile. The latter is obtained considering the user requirements, and generalizing the user data from a large-scale demographic database. The evaluation of our algorithm shows that our system accurately identifies the demographic groups where a user may belong, and generates highly accurate recommendations that match his/her preference value scale. {\textcopyright} IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},

abstract = {Numerous domestic and foreign studies have demonstrated that music can relieve stress and that listening to music is one method of stress relief used presently. Although stress-relief music is available on the market, various music genres produce distinct effects on people. Clinical findings have indicated that approximately 30 % of people listen to inappropriate music genres for relaxation and, consequently, their stress level increases. Therefore, to achieve the effect of stress relief, choosing the appropriate music genre is crucial. For example, a 70-year-old woman living in a military community since childhood might not consider general stress-relief music to be helpful in relieving stress, but when patriotic songs are played, her autonomic nervous system automatically relaxes because of her familiarity with the music style. Therefore, people have dissimilar needs regarding stress-relief music. In this paper, we proposed a personalized stress-relieving music recommendation system based on electroencephalography (EEG) feedback. The system structure comprises the following features: (a) automated music categorization, in which a new clustering algorithm, K-MeansH, is employed to precluster music and improve processing time; (b) the access and analysis of users' EEG data to identify perceived stress-relieving music; and (c) personalized recommendations based on collaborative filtering and provided according to personal preferences. Experimental results indicated that the overall clustering effect of K-MeansH surpassed that of K-Means and K-Medoids by approximately 71 and 57 %, respectively. In terms of accuracy, K-MeansH also surpassed K-Means and K-Medoids.},
