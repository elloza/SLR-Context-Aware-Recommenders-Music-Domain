abstract = {Traditional recommendation methods suffer from limited performance, which can be addressed by incorporating abundant auxiliary/side information. This article focuses on a personalized music recommender system that incorporates rich content and context data in a unified and adaptive way to address the abovementioned problems. The content information includes music textual content, such as metadata, tags, and lyrics, and the context data incorporate users' behaviors, including music listening records, music playing sequences, and sessions. Specifically, a heterogeneous information network (HIN) is first presented to incorporate different kinds of content and context data. Then, a novel method called content- and context-aware music embedding (CAME) is proposed to obtain the low-dimension dense real-valued feature representations (embeddings) of music pieces from HIN. Especially, one music piece generally highlights different aspects when interacting with various neighbors, and it should have different representations separately. CAME seamlessly combines deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms, with the embedding model to capture the intrinsic features of music pieces as well as their dynamic relevance and interactions adaptively. Finally, we further infer users' general musical preferences as well as their contextual preferences for music and propose a content- and context-aware music recommendation method. Comprehensive experiments as well as quantitative and qualitative evaluations have been performed on real-world music data sets, and the results show that the proposed recommendation approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is able to handle sparse data effectively.},

abstract = {Mood and emotion play an important role when it comes to choosing musical tracks to listen to. In the field of music information retrieval and recommendation, emotion is considered contextual information that is hard to capture, albeit highly influential. In this study, we analyze the connection between users' emotional states and their musical choices. Particularly, we perform a large-scale study based on two data sets containing 560,000 and 90,000 #nowplaying tweets, respectively. We extract affective contextual information from hashtags contained in these tweets by applying an unsupervised sentiment dictionary approach. Subsequently, we utilize a state-of-The-Art network embedding method to learn latent feature representations of users, tracks and hashtags. Based on both the affective information and the latent features, a set of eight ranking methods is proposed. We find that relying on a ranking approach that incorporates the latent representations of users and tracks allows for capturing a user's general musical preferences well (regardless of used hashtags or affective information). However, for capturing context-specific preferences (a more complex and personal ranking task), we find that ranking strategies that rely on affective information and that leverage hashtags as context information outperform the other ranking strategies.},

We have two motivations to extend the existing systems: (1) to the best of our knowledge, the current systems first estimate the user's emotions and then suggest music based on it. Therefore, the emotion estimation error affects the recommendation accuracy. (2) Studies show that the pattern of users' interactions with input devices can reflect their emotions. However, these patterns have not been used yet in emotion-aware music recommender systems. In this study, a music recommender system is proposed to suggest music based on users' keystrokes and mouse clicks patterns. Unlike the previous ones, the proposed system maps these patterns directly to the user's favorite music, without labeling its current emotion. The results show that even though this system does not use any additional device, it is highly accurate compared to previous methods.},

To select which music to recommend, traditional RS uses an approximation of users' real interests. However, while discarding users' contexts, profiles information is not able to reflect their exact needs and to provide overpowering recommendations. One of the main issues that have to be considered before the conception of context-aware recommender systems (CARS) is the estimation of the relevance of contextual information. The use of irrelevant or superfluous contextual factors can generate serious problems about the complexity and the quality of recommendations. In this paper, we introduce a multi-dimensional context model for music CARS. We started by the acquisition of explicit items rating from a population in various possible contextual situations. Thus, we proposed a user-based methodology aiming to judge the relation between contextual factors and musical genres. Next, we applied the Multiple Linear Regression technique on users' perceived ratings, to define an order of importance between contextual dimensions. We described raw collected data with basic statistics about the created dataset. We also summarized the key results and discussed key findings. Finally, we propose a new framework for Music CARS.},

abstract = {In music recommender systems, automatic playlist continuation is an emerging task that aims to improve users' listening experience by recommending music in line with their musical taste. The typical approach towards this goal is to identify playlist characteristics by inspecting the existing tracks (i.e., seeds) in target playlists. However, seeds are not always available, especially when users create new playlists. For such cold-start situations, user-generated titles can be a good starting point to understand the intended purpose of users. This paper investigates the effectiveness of titles as an auxiliary data source for playlists suffering from the cold-start problem. Employing three naive recommendation models, we conduct experiments on one million music playlists from the Spotify platform. Our analyses show that the prevalent attitude in naming playlists results in highly accurate recommendations for playlists concerning a specific theme, such as albums, artists, and soundtracks. As the title space moves away from a particular theme, recommendation accuracy drops. Furthermore, the correlation between the common preference of a title and its usability in recommendation is quite weak; a title without a common sense may be useless in recommender systems, even though many users favor that title. Consequently, our findings serve as a guideline to develop title-aware recommendation approaches that can provide coherent continuations to the cold-start playlists.},

abstract = {Decision making is the cognitive process of identifying and choosing alternatives based on preferences, beliefs, and degree of importance given by the decision maker to objects or actions. For instance, choosing which movie to watch is a simple, small-sized decision-making process. Recommender systems help people to make this kind of choices, usually by computing a short list of suggestions that reduces the space of possible options. These systems are strongly based on the knowledge of user preferences but, in order to fully support people, they should be grounded on a holistic view of the user behavior, that includes also how emotions, mood, and personality traits influence her choosing patterns. In this work, we investigate how to include emotional aspects in the recommendation process. We suggest that the affective state of the user, defined by a set of emotions (e.g., joy, surprise), constitutes part of choosing situation that should be taken into account when modeling user preferences. The main contribution of the paper is a general emotion-aware computational model based on affective user profiles in which each preference, such as a 5-star rating on a movie, is associated with the affective state felt by the user at the time when that preference was collected. The model estimates whether an unseen item is suitable for the current affective state of the user, by computing an affective coherence score that takes into account both the affective user profile and not-affective item features. The approach has been implemented into an Emotion-aware Music Recommender System, whose effectiveness has been assessed by performing in-vitro experiments on two benchmark datasets. The main outcome is that our system showed improved accuracy of recommendations compared to baselines which include no affective information in the recommendation model.},

This has opened up a research area, namely the identification of biases introduced by recommender systems in the music context. Recent research, which focused on users of the Last.fm platform found that state-of-the-art music recommendation systems frequently tend to favor already popular items. To this end, we propose a new method for predicting music recommendations, which relies on a cluster-based quotas system. By assuming the distribution of the popularity of artists to have a latent variable that is estimated with a Gaussian Mixture, we find the underlying popularity clusters and use them to make the predictions by quotas that relate to each cluster mixing proportion, in a way that the resulting popularity distribution in the recommendations is closer to the popularity distribution seen in the data. In our experiments with the Last.fm data, our final predictions increased the recommendation frequencies of less popular artists, while preserving the specific characteristics of each algorithm. The GAP(g)r and mean average error (MAE) metrics are improved, showing that our recommendations are more accurate and approximate to the expected popularity of the artists in each user profile.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method for recommending music items without explicit feedback. Context and content features are used as auxiliary information to compensate for implicit feedback. The recent development of communication technology and portable electronic devices has changed the way of consuming music. We can access a vast amount of music items via online music streaming services. As a result, finding appropriate music items from enormous resources gets to be difficult for users. To help users discover their favorite music items, recommender systems in the music domain have been studied. This paper focuses on two challenges specific to music recommender systems: the difficulty of obtaining explicit feedback such as ratings, and the importance of making use of context information. To handle the context information as auxiliary information to compensate for implicit feedback, this paper employs FMs (Factorization Machines), in which the context information is treated as features. Utilizing the merit of FMs that can easily introduce features, this paper also introduces content features in addition to context features. As it is known that using low-level content features directly is not effective because of the semantic gap, this paper proposes two types of abstract content features: UGP (user genre profile) and UCP (user content profile). The effectiveness of the proposed method and the effect of negative sampling methods are evaluated in terms of MPR with #nowplaying-rs and LFM-1b dataset. The result of the experiment shows that the proposed method outperforms wALS (weighted Alternating Least Squares), which is one of the popular music recommendation algorithms based on matrix factorization. The characteristics of the proposed sampling methods are investigated with different settings of the parameters and the ratio of negative samples. As for the effectiveness of each feature, it is found that a feature is effective when JS (Jensen-Shannon) divergence of popularity distribution among different feature values is large. It is also shown that the UCP and UGP cluster labels are more effective than using content features directly.},

Distinctions between research in these fields are highlighted, with reference to the beliefs and values that are most congruent with each of these contexts. Following this reflective review on the literature, I provide five recommendations for consideration by researchers and practitioners. These include: determining if and when evidence is an appropriate focus; continuing to seek understanding; not underestimating the value of positive experiences; avoiding an exclusive focus on the music therapist's perspective; and being realistic about the outcomes of group versus individual therapy.

However, in addition to gathering information about users' tastes, there is an additional aspect that can be relevant for a proper codification strategy, namely the order in which the user interacted with the items. In this paper, several encoding strategies based on neural networks are analyzed and applied to solve two different recommendation tasks in the context of music playlists. The results show that the order in which the musical pieces were listened to is relevant for the codification of items (songs). We also find that the encoding of user profiles should use a different amount of historical data depending on the learning task to be solved.

Robotic musicianship has evolved from isolated novelty to a growing field of research with audience-inspiring outcomes (Hoffman and Weinberg in Auton Robot 31(2–3):133–153, [1]). Between 2002 and 2017 the number of members in the International Society for Music Information Retrieval has grown from about 500 to well over 2000 (https://www.ismir.net/stats.php ). As the field of artificial intelligence for music-related tasks continues to grow, so grows the need for better, more robust learning systems that are able to more deeply understand people's responses, preferences, and intentions to music. Such learning systems are not only valuable in the specific contexts in which understanding music, and human psychology with respect to music, is valuable, but also has broader implications regarding learning systems in general. From reasoning about implicit mental states in human counterparts and how they are affected by surrounding stimuli, to temporal adaptation to changing preferences and circumstances, to online context-aware recommendation, music serves as an excellent testbed for a wider, broader array of more general questions involving continual learning, system adaptation, and social agents.},

Meanwhile, manifold personal factors of users are also important for the problem, and research efforts have been made to improve the recommendation performance with auxiliary user information. As an important indicator of users' personal traits and states, the numerous social media content (e.g., texts, images and short videos), however, is still hardly exploited. In this work, we systematically study the utilization of multimodal social media content for music recommendation. We define groups of both targeted handcrafted features and generic deep features for each modality, and further propose an Attentive Multimodal Autoencoder approach (AMAE) to learn cross-modal latent representations from the extracted features. Attention mechanism is also employed to integrate users' global and contextual music preference with alterable weights. Experiments demonstrate remarkable improvement of recommendation performance (+2.40% in Hit Ratio and +3.30% in NDCG), manifesting the effectiveness of our AMAE approach, as well as the significance of incorporating social media content data in music recommendation.},

Therefore, emotional preference should be taken into consideration especially when building context-aware music recommendation systems which aim to satisfy users' short-term music needs. In addition, cultural differences will affect the way people experience and value emotion from music. Based on these aspects, we investigate the emotional preference of music in daily activities through a cross-cultural survey in China and the UK, and build emotional maps between activity and music for the two countries. Furthermore, we introduce EmoMusic, a novel emotion-based music recommendation service for daily activities which supports visualisation and control of music emotion through an interactive interface. A user study is presented to evaluate the application. Results reveal good usability of the service and show that visualization and interaction in a music emotion space can improve acceptance of music recommendations. Our work helps to understand the emotional preference of music for various activities and how to exploit emotional cues of music in a music recommendation service, paving the way for more user-centered music recommendation systems.},

Instead of the metadata, such as genres and artists, the proposed approach takes the listening environment into consideration. By using the listening environment, it is possible to recommend music lyrics that fit the atmosphere of a touristspot when the user enjoys the sightseeing. In this paper, the proposed method recommends the lyrics that fits the atmosphere of a tourist-spot by sharing the distributed representation beyond the domains of lyrics and reviews. The method uses a corpus of lyrics to build the distributed representation model, and both lyrics' and reviews' vectors are calculated with the model. As a result, the tourist-spot reviews are assumed to be types of lyrics. Based on the lyric-like vector representation of reviews, the similarity between reviews and lyrics can be calculated. The experiment showed a positive result to the recommendation made by the proposed method.},

abstract = {In the process of the rapid development of mobile networks, music recommendation systems (MRSs) have experienced considerable success in recent years. Conventional music recommendation systems are, however, in general based on the simple user–track relationships or the content of songs and recommend songs according to intrinsic factors. Furthermore they do not consider the users' contextual factors towards providing them with a more interpretable, efficient and smart recommendation experience. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Information Network-based Music Recommendation System (HIN-MRS). By considering the extrinsic factors, such as contextual factors, internal factors, such as the user's personalized preference, and the heterogeneous relationship between items of song information, this method can perceive the user's music selection from multiple aspects, automatically maintain the user's playlist and improve the user's music experience. First we used the obtained textual data to extract the user's music preference to provide the topic which is usually related to the contextual factors, by means of which an HIN-MRS can realize the perception of the mobile environment. Second, after determining the topics, we built a small-scale HIN of songs (song HIN) according to topics and used a graph-based algorithm to generate recommendations. The recommendation method based on an HIN renders the recommendation process more efficient and the recommendation results more accurate and increases the users satisfaction. The results of our final experiments also prove the significant advantages of the proposed model over the conventional approaches.},

abstract = {Recommender systems play an important role in providing an engaging experience on online music streaming services. However, the musical domain presents distinctive challenges to recommender systems: tracks are short, listened to multiple times, typically consumed in sessions with other tracks, and relevance is highly context-dependent. In this paper, we argue that modeling users' preferences at the beginning of a session is a practical and effective way to address these challenges. Using a dataset from Spotify, a popular music streaming service, we observe that a) consumption from the recent past and b) session-level contextual variables (such as the time of the day or the type of device used) are indeed predictive of the tracks a user will stream - much more so than static, average preferences. Driven by these findings, we propose CoSeRNN, a neural network architecture that models users' preferences as a sequence of embeddings, one for each session. CoSeRNN predicts, at the beginning of a session, a preference vector, based on past consumption history and current context. This preference vector can then be used in downstream tasks to generate contextually relevant just-in-time recommendations efficiently, by using approximate nearest-neighbour search algorithms. We evaluate CoSeRNN on session and track ranking tasks, and find that it outperforms the current state of the art by upwards of 10% on different ranking metrics. Dissecting the performance of our approach, we find that sequential and contextual information are both crucial.},

abstract = {This is an extension from a selected paper from JSAI2019. This paper proposes a method for recommending music items considering listeners' context information. Recently, users can enjoy music easily regardless of time and a place due to evolution of online music services such as Spotify. However, it is difficult for us to find appropriate music items from enormous resources. On the other hand, because of listening style and characteristic of music items, music items do not usually have explicit rating. Therefore, implicit feedback such as playing count has been widely used to construct recommender systems. As additional information, this paper considers listeners' context. The proposed method employs FMs (Factorization Machines), in which the context information is treated as factors. Negative sampling is applied to reduce the number of negative samples (music items a user has yet to be listened). The effectiveness of the proposed method and the effect of negative sampling are evaluated with an offline experiment. The experimental result on nowplaying-rs dataset shows that the proposed method outperforms wALS (weighted Alternating Least Squares) method. Furthermore, different negative sampling methods such as popularity-based one and sampling with different time window size are also investigated.},

abstract = {In the last decade, music consumption has changed dramatically as humans have increasingly started to use music streaming platforms. While such platforms provide access to millions of songs, the sheer volume of choices available renders it hard for users to find songs they like. Consequently, the task of finding music the user likes is often mitigated by music recommender systems, which aim to provide recommendations that match the user's current context. Particularly in the field of music recommendation, adapting recommendations to the user's current context is critical as, throughout the day, users listen to different music in numerous different contexts and situations. Therefore, we propose a multi-context-aware user model and track recommender system that jointly exploit information about the current situation and musical preferences of users. Our proposed system clusters users based on their situational context features and similarly, clusters music tracks based on their content features. By conducting a series of offline experiments, we show that by relying on Factorization Machines for the computation of recommendations, the proposed multi-context-aware user model successfully leverages interaction effects between user listening histories, situational, and track content information, substantially outperforming a set of baseline recommender systems.},

The majority of these services are endowed with recommendation mechanisms that help users to discover songs and artists that may interest them from the vast amount of music available. However, many are not reliable as they may not take into account contextual aspects or the ever-evolving user behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to develop systems that consider these aspects. In the field of music, time is one of the most important factors influencing user preferences and managing its effects, and is the motivation behind the work presented in this paper. Here, the temporal information regarding when songs are played is examined. The purpose is to model both the evolution of user preferences in the form of evolving implicit ratings and user listening behavior. In the collaborative filtering method proposed in this work, daily listening habits are captured in order to characterize users and provide them with more reliable recommendations. The results of the validation prove that this approach outperforms other methods in generating both context-aware and context-free recommendations.},

Social networks enclose valuable data regarding user behavior and connections that can be exploited in this area to infer knowledge about user preferences and social influence. The fact that streaming music platforms have some social functionalities also allows this type of information to be used for music recommendation. In this work, we take advantage of the friendship structure to address a type of recommendation bias derived from the way collaborative filtering methods compute the neighborhood. These methods restrict the rating predictions for a user to the items that have been rated by their nearest neighbors while leaving out other items that might be of his/her interest. This problem is different from the popularity bias caused by the power-law distribution of the item rating frequency (long-tail), well-known in the music domain, although both shortcomings can be related. Our proposal is based on extending and diversifying the neighborhood by capturing trust and homophily effects between users through social structure metrics. The results show an increase in potentially recommendable items while reducing recommendation error rates.},

abstract = {Music has emerged to be of paramount importance to humanity and is not only considered as a source of entertainment but also an agent that causes social and psychological influences. A large number of existing digital music libraries have improved awareness among people through the music recommendation approach. However, several critical technical challenges still require attention and must be well–addressed to provide a reliable recommendation to music listeners. In Indian Classical Music, Raga is composed of coalescing diverse musical note structures. The history of classical music unveils that every raga possesses some distinct sessions. With a vast collection of classical music files in online music libraries, locating and listening to classical music is no more a difficult task. However, searching and listening to the audio of one's preference may not be simple as it must instinctively satisfy the listener's preference in a precise session. In this paper, a system termed as iMusic has been proposed to classify, analyze, and recommend the session–sensitive performance of Indian classical music by analyzing the musical note structures followed by features matching. Available note-patterns in the raga performance have been illustrated using a deep neural network and a set of machine learning algorithms where raga samples have been represented as inputs in the projected network and are classified based on the performing sessions. A context-aware k-means clustering algorithm has also been illustrated, entitled as a data filtering algorithm. The proficiency of the filtering algorithm has been established in two ways. Primarily, as a data-sensitive analysis, and second as empirical studies on synthetically obtained real classical music dataset (https://github.com/SamarjitRoy89/iMusic.git) to put on the hybrid music recommendation. In this work, a case-study of session-sensitive Indian music recommender system has been demonstrated using key-strategies viz. listener modelling, representation learning, and music profiling. Eventually, several evaluation metrics have been discussed to characterize the effectiveness of proposed representation learning-based playing session-sensitive music recommendation strategies. The proposed iMusic system renders data classification accuracy of $\sim$ 88%. Such a framework could provide a useful basis regarding studies on hybrid music recommendation systems based on the usefulness of end-users.},

It has achieved rapid development in theoretical research and practice. It selects information and similarity relationships based on the user's history and collects others that are the same as the user's hobbies. User's evaluation information is to generate recommendations. The main research is the inadequate combination of context information and the mining of new points of interest in the context-aware recommendation process. On the basis of traditional recommendation technology, in view of the characteristics of the context information in music recommendation, a personalized and personalized music based on popularity prediction is proposed. Recommended algorithm is MRAPP (Media Recommendation Algorithm based on Popularity Prediction). The algorithm first analyzes the user's contextual information under music recommendation and classifies and models the contextual information. The traditional content-based recommendation technology CB calculates the recommendation results and then, for the problem that content-based recommendation technology cannot recommend new points of interest for users, introduces the concept of popularity. First, we use the memory and forget function to reduce the score and then consider user attributes and product attributes to calculate similarity; secondly, we use logistic regression to train feature weights; finally, appropriate weights are used to combine user-based and item-based collaborative filtering recommendation results. Based on the above improvements, the improved collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm in this paper has greatly improved the prediction accuracy. Through theoretical proof and simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the MRAPP algorithm is demonstrated.},

The recent work of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of movie recommendations has shown that this popularity bias leads to unfair treatment of both long-tail items as well as users with little interest in popular items. In this paper, we reproduce the analyses of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of music recommendation. Specifically, we investigate three user groups from the Last.fm music platform that are categorized based on how much their listening preferences deviate from the most popular music among all Last.fm users in the dataset: (i) low-mainstream users, (ii) medium-mainstream users, and (iii) high-mainstream users. In line with Abdollahpouri et al., we find that state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms favor popular items also in the music domain. However, their proposed Group Average Popularity metric yields different results for Last.fm than for the movie domain, presumably due to the larger number of available items (i.e., music artists) in the Last.fm dataset we use. Finally, we compare the accuracy results of the recommendation algorithms for the three user groups and find that the low-mainstreaminess group significantly receives the worst recommendations.},

abstract = {In developing a music recommendation system, there are several factors that can contribute to the inefficiency in music selection. One of the problems persists during the music listening is that common music playing application lacks the ability to acquire context of the user. Another problem that common music recommendation system fails to address the emotional impact of the recommended song. To address this gap, this paper presents a music recommendation system based on fuzzy inference engine that considers user activities and emotion as part of the recommendation parameters. The system includes building a smart music recommendation system that has user profiling capabilities to recommend correct songs based on the user's preferences, mood and time. Findings of the this paper have shown that Heartbeats's fuzzy inference engine has successfully achieved its aim, which is to improve users' music listening experience by giving suitable song recommendation based on user context situation.},

Music can have a positive influence on runners' motivation and performance, but it requires selecting the most suitable song at each moment. Most of the music recommendation systems combine users' preferences and context-aware factors to predict the next song. In this paper, we include runners' emotions as part of these decisions. This fact has forced us to emotionally annotate the songs available in the system, to monitor runners' emotional state and to interpret these data in the recommendation algorithms.

abstract = {A large amount of research in recommender systems focuses on algorithmic accuracy and optimization of ranking metrics. However, recent work has unveiled the importance of other aspects of the recommendation process, including explanation, transparency, control and user experience in general. Building on these aspects, this paper introduces MoodPlay, an interactive music-artists recommender system which integrates content and mood-based filtering in a novel interface. We show how MoodPlay allows the user to explore a music collection by musical mood dimensions, building upon GEMS, a music-specific model of affect, rather than the traditional Circumplex model. We describe system architecture, algorithms, interface and interactions followed by use-case and offline evaluations of the system, providing evidence of the benefits of our model based on similarities between the typical moods found in an artist's music, for contextual music recommendation. Finally, we present results of a user study (N = 279) in which four versions of the interface are evaluated with varying degrees of visualization and interaction. Results show that our proposed visualization of items and mood information improves user acceptance and understanding of both the underlying data and the recommendations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the role of mood in music recommendation, considering both artists' mood and users' self-reported mood in the user study. Our results and discussion highlight the impact of visual and interactive features in music recommendation, as well as associated human-cognitive limitations. This research also aims to inform the design of future interactive recommendation systems.},

abstract = {Context-aware systems are intelligent systems that recommend users with adaptive service choices which are appropriate to their profile preferences and contextual situations. However, the key challenges in these systems are extracting dynamic context information and updating user's profile information. Recently by the popularity of IoT devices as well as the availability of the wireless network, a massive volume of data is available to gain useful insights into user profile which contains dynamic contextual information. IoT sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data, we need to understand them and use them in a context-aware computing platform. In this article, an adaptive context-aware service composition system is proposed using an IoT based social network dataset to find users' preferences, improve quality of experience, and boosts the personalization level of services. This paper proposes an 10T-based context-aware service composition to seamlessly find adaptive services offered by a service provider at anytime and anywhere. Firstly, the proposed system considers the dynamic social profile of the user and clusters their preferences while other systems take only static user interests into account. Secondly, this system increases the level of personalization by extracting context information from a user's IoT devices. Finally, the adaptive service composition provides users with various context-aware recommendation including movies, music, venues, radio stations, and events simultaneously. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed system, we target some of the smart objects such as smart watches/bands, smartphones/tablets, Google Home, and personal computers for detecting several contexts (e.g location, time, user activity, interest and e.t.c.). Experimental evaluations show that the proposed algorithm can improve accuracy and personalization of filtered items with compare to other widely-applied conventional filtering algorithms.},

In the proposed method, a deep residual bidirectional gated recurrent neural network is applied to obtain high activity recognition accuracy from accelerometer signals on the smartphone. In order to improve the performance of tempo-oriented music classification, an ensemble of dynamic classification using a long-term modulation spectrum and sequence classification using a short-term spectrogram is used. Music recommendation is performed using the relationship between the recognized human activities and the music files indexed by tempo-oriented music classification that reflects user preference models in order to achieve high user satisfaction. The results of comprehensive experiments on real data confirm the accuracy of the proposed activity-aware music recommendation framework.},

Online music service providers are devoted to recommend personalized music to users, so that more users can be attracted by spending more money on their music service platform. Hence, an accurate recommendation for users is one of the most important tasks for the music service companies. This paper proposes a novel recommender system for recommending music. According to the preliminary measurement, we find that the interest of users on music changes over time. Furthermore, we notice that the time interval between two consecutive listened/sung musics can reflect the temporal interests of users. Based on these findings, we propose MusicRecLSTM, which leverages the attention mechanism and a modified LSTM network to learn the embeddings of both the user and the music based on the sequential data and the temporal context. MusicRecLSTM also learns whether a user would tend to listen to a newly released music at a specific time. Evaluations over three real-world datasets show that the proposed MusicRecLSTM can provide high precision, compared to several state-of-the-art recommender systems, with at least 20% improvement on the recall and mean reciprocal metrics.},

By conducting a mixed-design study (N=114) with four typical scenarios of music listening, we investigate the effect of controlling contextual characteristics in a music recommender system on four aspects: perceived quality, diversity, effectiveness, and cognitive load. Compared to our baseline which only allows to specify music preferences, having additional control for context leads to higher perceived quality and does not increase cognitive load. We also find that the contexts of mood, weather, and location tend to influence user perception of the system.

We have been witnessing an ever-increasing amount of music data. At the same time, with the huge amount of online music data, users are facing an everyday struggle to obtain their interested music pieces. To solve this problem, music search and recommendation systems are helpful for users to find their favorite content from a huge repository of music. However, social influence, which contains rich information about similar interests between users and users' frequent correlation actions, has been largely ignored in previous music recommender systems. In this work, we explore the effects of social influence on developing effective music recommender systems and focus on the problem of social influence aware music recommendation, which aims at recommending a list of music tracks for a target user. To exploit social influence in social influence aware music recommendation, we first construct a heterogeneous social network, propose a novel meta path-based similarity measure called WPC, and denote the framework of similarity measure in this network. As a step further, we use the topological potential approach to mine social influence in heterogeneous networks. Finally, in order to improve music recommendation by incorporating social influence, we present a factor graphic model based on social influence. Our experimental results on one real world dataset verify that our proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art music recommendation methods substantially.},

The traditional music recommendation strategy captured users' music preference by analyzing their historical behaviors to conduct personalized recommendation. However, users' current states, such as in busy working or in a leisure travel, etc., have an important influence on their music enjoyment. Usually, those existing methods only focus on pushing their favorite music to users, which may be not the most suitable for current scenarios. Users' current states should be taken into account to make more perfect music recommendation. Considering the above problem, this paper proposes a music recommendation method by considering both users' current states and their historical behaviors. First, a feature selection process based on ReliefF method is applied to discover the optimal features for the following recommendation. Second, we construct different feature groups according to the feature weights and introduce Naive Bayes model and Adaboost algorithm to train these feature groups, which will output a base classifier for each feature group. Finally, a majority voting strategy decides the optimal music type and each user will be recommended more suitable music based on their current context.

While the accuracy achieved in next-song recommendations is important, in this work we shift our focus toward a deeper understanding of fundamental playlist characteristics, namely the song order, the song context and the song popularity, and their relation to the recommendation of playlist continuations. We also propose an approach to assess the quality of the recommendations that mitigates known problems of off-line experiments for music recommender systems. Our results indicate that knowing a longer song context has a positive impact on next-song recommendations. We find that the long-tailed nature of the playlist datasets makes simple and highly expressive playlist models appear to perform comparably, but further analysis reveals the advantage of using highly expressive models. Finally, our experiments suggest that the song order is not crucial to accurately predict next-song recommendations.},

To mitigate this issue, diversity-enhanced user interfaces for recommender systems have in the past found to be effective in increasing overall user satisfaction with recommendations. However, users may have different requirements for diversity, and consequently different visualization requirements. In this paper, we evaluate two visual user interfaces, SimBub and ComBub, to present the diversity of a music recommender system from different perspectives. SimBub is a baseline bubble chart that shows music genres and popularity by color and size, respectively. In addition, ComBub visualizes selected audio features along the X and Y axis in a more advanced and complex visualization. Our goal is to investigate how individual traits such as musical sophistication (MS) and visual memory (VM) influence the satisfaction of the visualization for perceived music diversity, overall usability, and support to identify blind-spots. We hypothesize that music experts, or people with better visual memory, will perceive higher diversity in ComBub than SimBub. A within-subjects user study (N=83) is conducted to compare these two visualizations. Results of our study show that participants with high MS andVMtend to perceive significantly higher diversity from ComBub compared to SimBub. In contrast, participants with low MS perceived significantly higher diversity from SimBub than ComBub; however, no significant result is found for the participants with low VM. Our research findings show the necessity of considering individual traits while designing diversity-aware interfaces.},

@inproceedings{dedieu2018hierarchical,
abstract = {An important metric of users' satisfaction and engagement within on-line streaming services is the user session length, i.e. the amount of time they spend on a service continuously without interruption. Being able to predict this value directly benefits the recommendation and ad pacing contexts in music and video streaming services. Recent research has shown that predicting the exact amount of time spent is highly nontrivial due to many external factors for which a user can end a session, and the lack of predictive covariates. Most of the other related literature on duration based user engagement has focused on dwell time for websites, for search and display ads, mainly for post-click satisfaction prediction or ad ranking. In this work we present a novel framework inspired by hierarchical Bayesian modeling to predict, at the moment of login, the amount of time a user will spend in the streaming service. The time spent by a user on a platform depends upon user-specific latent variables which are learned via hierarchical shrinkage. Our framework enjoys theoretical guarantees and naturally incorporates flexible parametric/nonparametric models on the covariates, including models robust to outliers. Our proposal is found to outperform state-of-the-art estimators in terms of efficiency and predictive performance on real world public and private datasets.},

abstract = {Related item recommenders operate in the context of a particular item. For instance, a music system's page about the artist Radio-head might recommend other similar artists such as The Flaming Lips. Often central to these recommendations is the computation of similarity between pairs of items. Prior work has explored many algorithms and features that allow for the computation of similarity scores, but little work has evaluated these approaches from a user-centric perspective. In this work, we build and evaluate six similarity scoring algorithms that span a range of activity- and content-based approaches. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using both offline metrics and a new set of more than 22,000 user-contributed evaluations. We integrate these results with a survey of more than 700 participants concerning their expectations about item similarity and related item recommendations. We find that content-based algorithms outperform ratings- and clickstream-based algorithms in terms of how well they match user expectations for similarity and recommendation quality. Our results yield a number of implications to guide the construction of related item recommendation algorithms.},

However, it still needs to be studied how to obtain and utilize the contextual information. In this paper, we propose a context-aware music recommendation approach, which can recommend music pieces appropriate for users' contextual preferences for music. In analogy to matrix factorization methods for collaborative filtering, the proposed approach does not require music pieces to be represented by features ahead, but it can learn the representations from users' historical listening records. Specifically, the proposed approach first learns music pieces' embeddings (feature vectors in low-dimension continuous space) from music listening records and corresponding metadata. Then it infers and models users' global and contextual preferences for music from their listening records with the learned embeddings. Finally, it recommends appropriate music pieces according to the target user's preferences to satisfy her/his real-time requirements. Experimental evaluations on a real-world dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, and hitrate. Especially, our approach has better performance on sparse datasets.},

Although existing methods of similar retrieval or sequence prediction have attained success to some extend, one important factor has not been considered in the previous work, that is, users may change their music interest in different sessions. How to define the users' current interest is still a problem. In this paper, we propose a topic-based probabilistic model for addressing this problem by developing session-aware latent topics to model the users' listening behavior. The model is designed based on the insight that users' listening behavior is subjected to not only their personal interest, but also to their special interest in the session. Specifically, when making recommendation, our model estimates the probability of the song selection based on the mixture of the two aspects with a weight-based scheme. We have conducted experiments on a real music dataset from Last.fm. The empirical results demonstrate that our model performs much better than other state-of-the-art methods.},

To investigate this topic, we created and evaluated a prototype music recommender system called Reflektor. Reflektor interactively visualizes users' chat conversations to generate music playlists. Our analysis of user conversations with Reflektor uncovered distinct strategies participants use to create the ambiance and conduct for social contexts.

The most existing models only focus on explicit data like ratings and other user-item dimensions. A challenging problem in music recommendation is to model a variety of contextual information, such as feedback, time and location. In this article, we proposed a competent hybrid music recommender system (HMRS), which works on context and collaborative approaches. The timestamp is extracted from users listening log to construct a decision context behavior that extracted various temporal features like a week, sessions(as morning, evening or night). We used depth-first-search (DFS) algorithm which traverses the whole graph through the paths in different contexts. Bellman-Ford algorithm provides ranked list of recommended items with multi-layer context graph. We enhanced the process using particle swarm optimization (PSO) which produced highly optimized results. The dataset is used from Last.fm which contains 19,150,868 music listening logs of 992 users (till May, 4th 2009). We extract the properties of music from user's listening history and evaluate the efficient system to recommend music based on user's contextual preferences. Our system noticeably delivers the best recommendations regarding recall results when compared to existing methods.},

Current music recommendation systems are facing two key challenges: (1) users' listening habits with respect to time haven't been well studied; (2) there are far less ratings than listening records in music providing systems. In this paper, we strive to address the above two challenges. We investigate when and what music will a user listen to, and we propose a Fine-grained Time-Aware Music Recommendation (FTAMR) model. To be specific, we improve recommendation qualities from two sides: The user and the song. From the user's side, we study users' listening time-behavior in a fine-grained way and explore their short-Term listening habits (e.g. in a day) and long-Term listening habits (e.g. in several months); From the song's side, considering the sparsity of ratings and the characteristics (e.g., popularity) of each song, we define the asymmetric co-recommendation probability from a song to another, and cluster songs according to co-recommendation probabilities instead of similarities. Given users' listening records with time stamps, we make recommendation based on their listening habits and songs' co-recommendation probabilities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed FTAMR model, we study the Last.fm data set and conduct extensive experiments. The results show that our approach can provide better recommendations.},

abstract = {Recommending music based on a user's music preference is a way to improve user listening experience. Finding the correlation between the user data (e.g., location, time of the day, music listening history, emotion, etc.) and the music is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware personalized music recommendation system (EPMRS) to extract the correlation between the user data and the music. To achieve this correlation, we combine the outputs of two approaches: the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) approach and the weighted feature extraction (WFE) approach. The DCNN approach is used to extract the latent features from music data (e.g., audio signals and corresponding metadata) for classification. In the WFE approach, we generate the implicit user rating for music to extract the correlation between the user data and the music data. In the WFE approach, we use the term-frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach to generate the implicit user ratings for the music. Later, the EPMRS recommends songs to the user based on calculated implicit user rating for the music. We use the million songs dataset (MSD) to train the EPMRS. For performance comparison, we take the content similarity music recommendation system (CSMRS) as well as the personalized music recommendation system based on electroencephalography feedback (PMRSE) as the baseline systems. Experimental results show that the EPMRS produces better accuracy of music recommendations than the CSMRS and the PMRSE. Moreover, we build the Android and iOS APPs to get realistic data of user experience on the EPMRS. The collected feedback from anonymous users also show that the EPMRS sufficiently reflect their preference on music.},

abstract = {Music has become an accompaniment to everyday activities, such as shopping and navigating. Although people listen to music in a context-driven manner, music recommendation services typically ignore where a user is listening to the music. They also typically select music based on a single seed song, rather than ordering a user's created playlists for the best user experience. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) We present a survey of 15 DJs of college radio stations to identify their heuristics in creating playlists for radio shows. (2) We present an experimental study design to evaluate various scheduling (track ordering) strategies for mobile music consumption in situ, which is used to (3) conduct a field experiment that compares the user experience of three scheduling strategies (tempo, genre and location) against the gold standard of a playlist created by an experienced DJ (This work was completed when Anupriya Ankolekar and Thomas Sandholm were both researchers, and Louis Lei Yu was a postdoctoral research fellow at Hewlett Packard Labs. The majority of the experiments were conducted during the summer of 2011. The authors are listed here in alphabetical order).},

However, in the conversational applications, it is unable to capture users' real time music taste, which are dynamic and depend on user context including users' emotion, current activities or sites. To meet users' real time music preferences, we have developed a conversational music recommender system based on music knowledge graph, MusicRoBot (Music RecOmmendation Bot). We embed the music recommendation into a chatbot, integrating both the advantages of dialogue system and recommender system. In our system, conversational interaction helps capture more real-time and richer requirements. Users can receive real time recommendation and give feedbacks by conversation. Besides, MusicRoBot also provides the music Q&A function to answer several types of musical question by the music knowledge graph.

In this paper, we therefore propose a novel approach to jointly model users by the user's musical preferences and his/her cultural background. We describe the musical preferences of users by relying on the acoustic features of the songs the users have been listening to and characterize the cultural background of users by cultural and socio-economic features that we infer from the user's country. To evaluate the impact of the proposed user model on recommendation quality, we integrate the model into a culture-aware music recommender system. We show that incorporating both acoustic information of the tracks a user has listened to as well as the cultural background of users in the form of a music-cultural user model contributes to improved recommendation performance.},

The proposed framework leverages the available semantic labels (in terms of tags) of music tracks to complement a highly sparse user-item interaction matrix, which effectively addresses the data sparsity issue faced by most music recommendation systems. Music tracks are more accurately represented by aggregating the latent factors derived from both the tag space and the user interaction information. The proposed framework further employs a Gaussian state-space model to capture the evolving nature of users' preferences over time, which helps achieve time-sensitive recommendation of music. A variational approximation is developed to achieve fast inference and learning of model parameters. Experiments conducted using actual music data and comparison with state-of-the-art competitive recommendation algorithms help demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Traditional music recommendation systems (RS) rely on collaborative filtering technique (CF) to recommend songs or artists in which recommendations are made based on the neighboring analysis of items/users. It is computationally efficient and performs well when the data is ideally full, when there are limited user inputs or few user/item inputs, it immediately lost its competitive advantage. Additionally, traditional RS techniques including content-based one heavily rely on explicit user feedback (e.g. user rating) to generate recommendations. In music/song recommendation, however, implicit feedbacks such as play frequency, play list prevail. Making recommendation on such implicit feedbacks requires efficient and accurate latent factor learning techniques to construct user or item feature space, which is inherently computationally costly. This paper presents a new and lightweight classification model for Chinese song RS based on computational analysis of the lingual part of song lyrics. Through extracting and combining the term frequency and inverse document frequency (tf∗idf) from song lyrics, we construct a composite emotion point matrix for each song which can then be used to further classify songs based on its inherent emotion and make recommendation accordingly.},

abstract = {Music listening is an inherently cultural behavior, which may be shaped by users' backgrounds and contextual characteristics. Due to geographical, socio-economic, linguistic, and cultural factors as well as friendship networks, users in different countries may have different music preferences. Investigating cultural-socio-economic factors that might be associated with between-country differences in music preferences can facilitate music information retrieval, contribute to the prediction of users' music preferences, and improve music recommendation in cross-country contexts. However, previous literature provides limited empirical evidence of the relationships between possible cross-country differences on a wide range of socio-economic aspects and those in music preferences. To bridge this research gap, and drawing on a large-scale dataset, LFM-1b, this study examines the possible relationship between cross-country differences in artist, album, and genre listening frequencies as well as the cross-country distance in geographical, socio-economic, linguistic, cultural, and friendship connections using the Quadratic Assignment Procedure. Results indicate: (1) there is no significant relationship between geographical and economic distance on album, artist, and genre preferences' distance at the country-level; (2) the cross-country distance of three cultural dimensions (masculinity, long-term orientation, and indulgence) is positively associated with both the album and artist preferences distances; (3) the between-country distance in main languages has a positive relationship with the album, artist, and genre preferences distances across countries; (4) the density of friendship connections among countries negatively correlates to the cross-country preference distances in terms of artist and genre. Findings from this study not only expand knowledge of factors related to music preferences at the country level, but also can be integrated into real-world music recommendation systems that consider country-level music preferences.},

But more urgently, the current revolution in the music industry represents major opportunities and challenges for recommendation systems in general. Recommendation systems are now central to music streaming platforms, which are rapidly increasing in listenership and becoming the top source of revenue for the music industry. It is increasingly more common for a music listener to simply access music than to purchase and own it in a personal collection. In this scenario, recommendation calls no longer for a one-shot recommendation for the purpose of a track or album purchase, but for a recommendation of a listening experience, comprising a very wide range of challenges, such as sequential recommendation, or conversational and contextual recommendations. Recommendation technologies now impact all actors in the rich and complex music industry ecosystem (listeners, labels, music makers and producers, concert halls, advertisers, etc.). To highlight these developments, we focus on three use cases: automatic playlist generation, contextaware music recommendation, and recommendation in the creative process of music making.},

So to utilize this information efficiently, an innovative cluster based context-aware post-filtering approach has been propounded that implicitly segregates the users into clusters on the basis of high performing contextual dimensions; combine the clusters on the basis of contextual similarity and then re-rank the items according to the probability of relevance in a cluster.

While previous approaches for the task of determining the origin of music either focused solely on exploiting the audio content or web resources, we propose a method that fuses features from both sources in a way that outperforms standalone approaches. To this end, we propose the use of block-level features inferred from the audio signal to model music content. We show that these features outperform timbral and chromatic features previously used for the task. On the other hand, we investigate a variety of strategies to construct web-based predictors from web pages related to music pieces. We assess different parameters for this kind of predictors (e.g., number of web pages considered) and define a confidence threshold for prediction.

Additionally, we can leverage the power of the cloud to enable crowd sensing of the mood-mapping of various songs and enhance the effectiveness of situation-aware music delivery for drivers. The cloud can be used to aggregate the crowd sensed music mood-mapping data and improve the effectiveness of music delivery by providing accurate mood-mappings from the aggregated data. Currently, context-aware music delivery systems consider only features from the song for music mood-mapping. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to music mood-mapping for drivers which also incorporates the social context of a driver including age, gender and cultural background to enhance the effectiveness of music delivery in context-aware music recommendation systems for drivers.},

abstract = {New distribution channels like music streaming platforms paved way for making more and more diverse music available to users. Thus, music recommender systems got in the focus of research in academia as well as industry. Collaborative filtering-based recommender systems have been proven useful, but there is space left for improvements by adapting this general approach to better fit to the music recommendations problem. In this work, we incorporate context-based information about the music consumption into the recommendation process. This information is extracted from playlist names, which are analyzed and aggregated into so-called "contextual clusters". We find that the listening context plays an important role and thus allows for providing recommendations reaching precision values 33% higher than traditional approaches. Hence, the main contribution of this paper is a new method that extracts and integrates contextual information from playlist names into the recommendation process for improving music recommendations.},

abstract = {The choice of music in everyday life is greatly influenced by contextual circumstances surrounding music listeners. Music lovers create music playlists for various contexts and activities they are engaged in, and this is done manually by updating and loading new playlist each time a user changes activity or context. This does not make music listening enjoyable as much time and effort is spent on searching for songs that befit the current context and activity. This paper proposes a personalized context-aware music recommendation system, called MPlist, that dynamically and automatically creates a music playlist for music lovers based on their context (i.e., current location and activity), listening preference, nearby users listening profiles, other users listening preferences and music from labels and tags mined from music experts and the web. MPlist collects data from multiple sensors in a user's smart mobile device and uses them to infer the user's context and activity, thereby generating a playlist based on contextual preference. This approach has the advantage of solving the well-known cold start problem yet giving music lovers a personalized anywhere anytime music listening experience. MPlist classifier is built using both kNN and rule-based learning algorithms using sensor datasets and context-aware listening profile dataset. The context-analytic engine infers basic user activities and sends all the inferred content to the content provider so that the server can learn the music preferences given a particular context. The system exhibit performance as follows: accuracy is 0.944, F-measure is 0.945, and RMSE is 0.0978. This tends to suggest that context-aware music recommendation systems is probably what music lover expect from music stores.},

This paper proposes a graph-based emotion-aware music recommendation approach (GEMRec) by simultaneously taking a user's music listening history and emotion into consideration. The proposed approach models the relations between user,music,and emotion as a three-element tuple (user,music,emotion),upon which an Emotion Aware Graph (EAG) is built,and then a relevance propagation algorithm based on random walk is devised to rank the relevance of music items for recommendation. Evaluation experiments are conducted based on a real dataset collected from a Chinese microblog service in comparison to baselines. The results show that the emotional context from a user's microblogs contributes to improving the performance of music recommendation in terms of hitrate,precision,recall,and F1 score.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in mobile devices and cloud-based music service now allow consumers to enjoy music anytime and anywhere. Consequently, there has been an increasing demand in studying intelligent techniques to facilitate context-aware music recommendation. However, one important context that is generally overlooked is user's venue, which often includes surrounding atmosphere, correlates with activities, and greatly influences the user's music preferences. In this article, we present a novel venue-aware music recommender system called VenueMusic to effectively identify suitable songs for various types of popular venues in our daily lives. Toward this goal, a Location-aware Topic Model (LTM) is proposed to (i) mine the common features of songs that are suitable for a venue type in a latent semantic space and (ii) represent songs and venue types in the shared latent space, in which songs and venue types can be directly matched. It is worth mentioning that to discover meaningful latent topics with the LTM, a Music Concept Sequence Generation (MCSG) scheme is designed to extract effective semantic representations for songs. An extensive experimental study based on two large music test collections demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed topic model and MCSG scheme. The comparisons with state-of-the-art music recommender systems demonstrate the superior performance of VenueMusic system on recommendation accuracy by associating venue and music contents using a latent semantic space. This work is a pioneering study on the development of a venue-aware music recommender system. The results show the importance of considering the influence of venue types in the development of context-aware music recommender systems.},

In this paper, we suggest an emotion-aware music recommendation system that proposes songs and artists based on the mood of each user. First, we infer user's emotion using real-time weather information. Second, we classify songs and artists which are favorable in different weather conditions. To do so, we collect and combine daily chart of K-pop music and weather history data to find the music preference in different weather. It is used to recommend timely and favorable music to users after capturing their mood implcitly. Moreover the emotion-aware music recommendation system is extensible to provide a personalized service by using user's social media, heartbeat, time, location, and so on. We expect this would enrich user experience noticeably. Being aware of user's emotion will enable broad areas of industry to provide intelligent services in a user-friendly way.},

Research has shown that fatigue can adversely affect driving performance and increase risk of road accidents. It has been shown that driving performance is enhanced by stress-relieving music which thereby promotes safer driving. Context-aware music delivery systems promote safer driving through intelligent music recommendations based on contextual knowledge. Two key aspects of situation-aware music delivery are effectiveness and efficiency of music recommendation. Efficiency is a critical aspect in real-time context based music recommendation as the music delivery system should quickly sense any change in the situation and deliver suitable music before the sensed context-data becomes obsolete. We focus on the efficiency of situation-aware music delivery systems in this paper. Music mood-mapping is a process which helps in understanding the mood of a song and is hence used in situation-aware music recommendation systems. This process requires a large processing time due to the complex calculations and large sizes of music files involved. Hence, optimizing this process is the key to improving the efficiency of context-aware music delivery systems. Here, we propose a novel cloud and crowd-sensing based approach to considerably optimize the efficiency of situation-aware music delivery systems.},

Even though rating prediction is the prevailing paradigm in CFR, there are other issues which have gained significant attention with respect to the content and its variety. Coverage, which constitutes the degree to which recommendations cover the set of available items, is an important factor along with diversity of the items proposed to an individual, often measured by an average dissimilarity between all pairs of recommended items. In this paper, we argue that coverage and diversity cannot be effectively addressed by conventional CFR with pure similaritybased neighborhood creation processes, especially in sparse datasets. Motivated by the need for including wider content characteristics, we propose a novel neighbor selection technique which emphasizes on variety in preferences (to cover polyphony in selection). Our approach consists of a new metric, named "Exploriometer", which acts as a personality trait for users based on their rating behavior. We favor users who are explorers in order to increase polyphony, and subsequently coverage and diversity; but we still select similar users when we create neighborhoods as a solid basis in order to keep accuracy levels high. The proposed approach has been experimented by two realworld datasets (MovieLens1 and Yahoo! Music2) with coverage, diversity and accuracy aware recommendations extracted by both traditional CFR and CFR enhanced with our neighborhood creation process. We also introduce a new metric, inspired by the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, to estimate the diversity of recommended items. The derived results demonstrate that our neighbor selection technique can enhance coverage and diversity of the recommendations, especially on sparse datasets.

abstract = {Driving is an integral part of our everyday lives, but it is also a time when people are uniquely vulnerable. Previous research has demonstrated that not only does listening to suitable music while driving not impair driving performance, but it could lead to an improved mood and a more relaxed body state, which could improve driving performance and promote safe driving significantly. In this article, we propose SAfeDJ, a smartphone-based situation-aware music recommendation system, which is designed to turn driving into a safe and enjoyable experience. SAfeDJ aims at helping drivers to diminish fatigue and negative emotion. Its design is based on novel interactive methods, which enable in-car smartphones to orchestrate multiple sources of sensing data and the drivers' social context, in collaboration with cloud computing to form a seamless crowdsensing solution. This solution enables different smartphones to collaboratively recommend preferable music to drivers according to each driver's specific situations in an automated and intelligent manner. Practical experiments of SAfeDJ have proved its effectiveness in music-mood analysis, and moodfatigue detections of drivers with reasonable computation and communication overheads on smartphones. Also, our user studies have demonstrated that SAfeDJ helps to decrease fatigue degree and negative mood degree of drivers by 49.09% and 36.35%, respectively, compared to traditional smartphone-based music player under similar driving situations.},

User emotion, as one of the most important contexts, has the potential to improve music recommendation, but has not yet been fully explored due to the great difficulty of emotion acquisition. This article utilizes users' microblogs to extract their emotions at different granularity levels and during different time windows. The approach then correlates three elements: user, music and the user's emotion when he/she is listening to the music piece. Based on the associations extracted from a data set crawled from a Chinese Twitter service, we develop several emotion-aware methods to perform music recommendation. We conduct a series of experiments and show that the proposed solution proves that considering user emotional context can indeed improve recommendation performance in terms of hit rate, precision, recall, and F1 score.},

As an emerging technology to facilitate effective music retrieval on the move, intelligent recommendation has been recently received great attentions in recent years. While a large amount of efforts have been invested in the field, the technology is still in its infancy. One of the major reasons for this stagnation is due to inability of the existing approaches to comprehensively take multiple kinds of contextual information into account.

We collected a large dataset of full music listening histories (N=594K) of users of the Last.fm's scrobbler service from all around the globe, and formulated six approaches for identifying the time zone where these listening profiles have been generated based on their listeners' behaviour. The performance of these approaches was compared with a manually labelled dataset of listening profiles' time zones. We found that the best method was based on the assumption that people, in general, sleep during night time and submit fewer music logs. This approach, implemented by estimating the local minima of people's weekly aggregated listening profile, resulted in a 75 percent correctly identified time zones with a tolerance of ±1 hour.

In recent years, research on contextual music recommendation has emerged and new services have been introduced. Driving is one of the most common listening situations. It differs from other listening situations in that the main focus is on driving, which means the mental load is higher. The scenario of listening to music while driving has been neglected in past research and is therefore reflected by the limited integration of textual music adaptation in car radios or infotainment systems. This paper presents the results of a preliminary study involving a driving simulator created to analyze the effects of various types of music on subjects while driving. As the results of the subjective measure show, there is a strong influence on the mental load of participants listening to fast-paced music while driving. According to these findings, a first prototype of an application was implemented allowing the driver to adjust the music selection with respect to the mental load as well as personal preference. This application uses contextual parameters and performs as a research prototype for future real-driving studies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

Context-aware music recommender systems are capable of suggesting music items taking into consideration contextual conditions, such as the user's mood or location, that may influence the user's preferences at a particular moment. In this work, we consider a particular kind of context-aware recommendation task—selecting music content that fits a place of interest (POI). To address this problem we have used emotional tags assigned to both music tracks and POIs, and we have considered a set of similarity metrics for tagged resources to establish a match between music tracks and POIs. Following an initial web-based evaluation of the core matching technique, we have developed a mobile application that suggests an itinerary and plays recommended music for each visited POI, and evaluated it in a live user study. The results of the study show that users judge the recommended music as suited for the POIs, and that the music is rated higher when it is played in this usage scenario.},

abstract = {Successful music recommendation systems need to incorporate information on at least three levels: the music content, the music context, and the user context. The former refers to features derived from the audio signal; the second refers to aspects of the music or artist not encoded in the audio, nevertheless important to human music perception; the third refers to contextual aspects of the user which change dynamically. In this paper, we briefly review the well-researched categories of music content and music context features, before focusing on user-centric models, which have been neglected for a long time in music retrieval and recommendation approaches. In particular, we address the following tasks: (i) geospatial music recommendation from microblog data, (ii) user-aware music playlist generation on smart phones, and (iii) matching places of interest and music. The approaches presented for task (i) rely on large-scale data inferred from microblogs, motivated by the fact that social media represent an unprecedented source of information about every topic of our daily lives. Information about music items and artists is thus found in abundance in user-generated data. The questions of how to infer information relevant to music recommendation from microblogs and what to learn from them are discussed. So are different ways of incorporating this kind of information into state-of-the-art music recommendation algorithms. The presented approaches targeted at tasks (ii) and (iii) model the user in a more comprehensive way than just using information about her location and music listening habits. We report results of a user study aiming at investigating the relationship between music listening activity and a large set of contextual user features. Based on these, an intelligent mobile music player that automatically adapts the current playlist to the user context is presented. Eventually, we discuss different methods to solve task (iii), i.e., to determine music that suits a given place of interest, for instance, a major monument. In particular, we look into knowledge-based and tag-based methods to match music and places. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

Current texts in music therapy identify the importance of this critical and user-oriented perspective, but the relevance and implications for music therapy need to be outlined. Objective: This study explores service users' experiences of music therapy in mental health care, and the potential role of music therapy in the development of recovery-oriented service provision. Methods: We conducted a qualitative meta-synthesis of studies examining service users' experiences in music therapy; included were 14 studies with a total of 113 participants. Both first-hand account of participants and the researchers' representations of such statements were taken into account in the analysis. Findings: A taxonomy of four areas of users' experiences was identified: "having a good time;" "being together;" "feeling;"and "being someone."These core categories point towards music therapy as an arena that can be used by persons with mental health problems in their personal and social recovery process. Music therapy can contribute to the quality of mental health care by providing an arena for stimulation and development of strengths and resources that may contribute to growth of positive identity and hope for people with mental illness. Conclusions: The findings from this meta-synthesis indicate that the provision of music therapy closely resembles recognized benefits of a recovery-oriented practice.

abstract = {With the advent of the ubiquitous era, many studies have been devoted to various situation-aware services in the semantic web environment. One of the most challenging studies involves implementing a situation-aware personalized music recommendation service which considers the user's situation and preferences. Situation-aware music recommendation requires multidisciplinary efforts including low-level feature extraction and analysis, music mood classification and human emotion prediction. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for a situation-aware/user-adaptive music recommendation service in the semantic web environment. To do this, we first discuss utilizing knowledge for analyzing and retrieving music contents semantically, and a user adaptive music recommendation scheme based on semantic web technologies that facilitates the development of domain knowledge and a rule set. Based on this discussion, we describe our Context-based Music Recommendation (COMUS) ontology for modeling the user's musical preferences and contexts, and supporting reasoning about the user's desired emotions and preferences. Basically, COMUS defines an upper music ontology that captures concepts on the general properties of music such as titles, artists and genres. In addition, it provides functionality for adding domain-specific ontologies, such as music features, moods and situations, in a hierarchical manner, for extensibility.

As an innovation, our ontology can express detailed and complicated relations among music clips, moods and situations, which enables users to find appropriate music.

abstract = {The problem of user's interest to item matching is at the core of recommendation systems and search engines. This problem is well studied in different contexts such as item, document, music and movie recommendations. For the purpose of recommendation these systems store the context or the meta-data information about the item of interest (e.g. user rating for books, tags, price etc). However, the general approaches for finding relevant items for recommendation cannot be directly applied in the case when the context or meta-data information about the item of interest is missing. In this paper we describe an algorithmic approach to handle this problem of missing context for items. In the proposed approach we have extended the context of user's interest and developed an unsupervised algorithm to find the items of interest for the user. Finally the items are ranked based on their relevance to the user's interest. We study this problem in the domain of dataset recommendation where the meta-data information about the datasets is missing due to lack of coherent and complete repository for the research datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with real world dataset consisting of 20 user queries. We find that the proposed framework can recommend datasets for user queries with a recall of 90% in the top-4 recommendations. We also compared the performance of the dataset finding algorithm with the state of art supervised classification approach. We get a significant improvement of 36% using the proposed algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The idea is to recommend information that would be of interest to a user according to the user's surround context. Although remarkable progress has been made, relatively little research has been made to contextualize music playback based on a large-scale dataset of real-life listening records. This paper presents our recent endeavor in collecting 5,502 real-life listening records with context annotation using Android smartphones in-situ. The user-provided context annotation contains labels selected from 10 user activity categories and 10 user mood categories. Moreover, we also compute a rich set of sensor features to capture the context at which the users listen to music, encompassing location, time, acceleration, proximity, etc. Our evaluation shows that with such context information we are able to significantly improve the performance of music recommendation, using factorization machine as the recommendation engine. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

We introduce the idea of similarity, which has been widely studied in the filed of information retrieval, and incorporate multiple feature similarities into the FM framework, including content-based and context-based similarities. The similarity information not only captures the similar patterns from the referred objects, but enhances the convergence speed and accuracy of FM. In addition, in order to avoid the noise within large similarity of features, we also adopt the grouping FM as an extended method to model the problem. In our experiments, a music-recommendation dataset is used to assess the performance of the proposed approach. The datasets is collected from an online blogging website, which includes user listening history, user profiles, social information, and music information. Our experimental results show that, with various types of feature similarities the performance of music recommendation can be enhanced significantly. Furthermore, via the grouping technique, the performance can be improved significantly in terms of Mean Average Precision, compared to the traditional collaborative filtering approach. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Music recommendation systems based on Collaborative Filtering methods have been extensively developed over the last years. Typically, they work by analyzing the past user-song relationships, and provide informed guesses based on the overall information collected from other users. Although the music listening behavior is a repetitive and time-dependent process, these methods have not taken this into account and only consider user-song interaction for recommendation. In this work, we explore the usage of temporal context and session diversity in Session-based Collaborative Filtering techniques for music recommendation. We compared two techniques to capture the users' listening patterns over time: one explicitly extracts temporal properties and session diversity, to group and compare the similarity of sessions, the other uses a generative topic modeling algorithm, which is able to implicitly model temporal patterns. We evaluated the developed algorithms by measuring the Hit Ratio, and the Mean Reciprocal Rank. Results reveal that the inclusion of temporal information, either explicitly or implicitly, increases significantly the accuracy of the recommendation, while compared to the traditional session-based CF. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Web sites and online services now typically contain millions of music tracks, which complicate search, retrieval and discovery of music. Music recommender systems can address these issues by recommending relevant and novel music to a user based on personal musical tastes. A typical scenario in music recommendation is that the music consumption is focused on some popular tracks and the most unpopular tracks are rarely accessed (i.e., the Long Tail problem). In this paper, we evaluate the impact of using context-aware recommender systems to recommend music in the Long Tail. We perform a set of experiments by applying three different context-aware recommender systems on three different real world data sets. Our findings show that by using contextual information we can improve music recommendation in the Long Tail scenario. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The suggested hybrid approach combines two techniques - one based on representing both POIs and music with tags, and the other based on the knowledge of the semantic relations between the two types of items. We show that our approach can be scaled up using a novel music auto-tagging technique and we compare it in a live user study to: two non-hybrid solutions, either based on tags or on semantic relations; and to a context-free but personalized recommendation approach. In the considered scenario, i.e., a situation defined by a context (the POI), we show that personalization (via music preference) is not sufficient and it is important to implement effective adaptation techniques to the user's context. In fact, we show that the users are more satisfied with the recommendations generated by combining the tag-based and knowledge-based context adaptation techniques, which exploit orthogonal types of relations between places and music tracks. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

Unlike approaches that rely on music content and have been researched for almost two decades, music-contextbased (or contextual) approaches to music retrieval are a quite recent field of research within music information retrieval (MIR). Contextual data refers to all music-relevant information that is not included in the audio signal itself. In this article, we focus on contextual aspects of music primarily accessible through web technology. We discuss different sources of context-based data for individual music pieces and for music artists. We summarize various approaches for constructing similarity measures based on the collaborative or cultural knowledge incorporated into these data sources. In particular, we identify and review three main types of context-based similarity approaches: text-retrieval-based approaches (relying on web-texts, tags, or lyrics), cooccurrence-based approaches (relying on playlists, page counts, microblogs, or peer-to-peer-networks), and approaches based on user ratings or listening habits. This article elaborates the characteristics of the presented context-based measures and discusses their strengths as well as their weaknesses. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

The Septimu platform enables the MusicalHeart application to continuously monitor the heart rate and activity level of the user while listening to music. The physiological information and contextual information are then sent to a remote server, which provides dynamic music suggestions to help the user maintain a target heart rate. We provide empirical evidence that the measured heart rate is 75%-85% correlated to the ground truth with an average error of 7:5 BPM. The accuracy of the person-specific, 3-class activity level detector is on average 96:8%, where these activity levels are separated based on their differing impacts on heart rate. We demonstrate the practicality of MusicalHeart by deploying it in two real world scenarios and show that MusicalHeart helps the user achieve a desired heart rate intensity with an average error of less than 12:2%, and its quality of recommendation improves over time.

abstract = {Contextual factors can greatly inuence the users' preferences in listening to music. Although it is hard to capture these factors directly, it is possible to see their effects on the sequence of songs liked by the user in his/her current interaction with the system. In this paper, we present a context-aware music recommender system which infers contextual information based on the most recent sequence of songs liked by the user. Our approach mines the top frequent tags for songs from social tagging Web sites and uses topic modeling to determine a set of latent topics for each song, representing different contexts. Using a database of human-compiled playlists, each playlist is mapped into a sequence of topics and frequent sequential patterns are discov- ered among these topics. These patterns represent frequent sequences of transitions between the latent topics representing contexts. Given a sequence of songs in a user's current interaction, the discovered patterns are used to predict the next topic in the playlist. The predicted topics are then used to postfilter the initial ranking produced by a traditional recommendation algorithm. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a conventional recommender system based on collaborative or content-based filtering. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach proposed here is also useful in providing better insight into the underlying reasons for song selection and in applications such as playlist construction and context prediction.

abstract = {Contextual factors can greatly influence users' decisions in selecting items, such as songs when listening to music. The goal of a context-aware recommender system is to adapt its recommendations not just to the general preferences of users, but also to the context in which users are seeking those rec- ommendations. In the domain of music recommendation, the explicit contextual factors and their values might not be known to the system, a priori. Moreover, the contextual state of a user can be dynamic and change during an inter- action with the system. In this paper, we present a hybrid context-aware recommender system which infers contextual information from the sequence of songs listened to or specified by a user and uses this information to produce context- aware recommendations. Our system mines popular tags for songs from social media Web sites and uses a topic modeling approach to learn latent topics representing various contexts. We then model each song as a set of latent topics capturing the general characteristics of that song. This representation is used to track and detect changes in user's choice of mu- sic, as reffected in a playlist of song sequence, and adjust the recommendations to better meet the current context of the user. Using our approach, the contextual information can be integrated with any traditional recommendation al- gorithm to produce context-aware recommendations. For our system, we designed and evaluated two hybrid meth- ods. The first hybrid combines collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation techniques, and the second hybrid additionally incorporates information about pairwise song associations. Our evaluation results show that both the hybrid approach and the contextualization can enhance the performance of baseline music recommendation method. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {Context aware recommender systems (CARS) adapt to the specific situation in which the recommended item will be consumed. So, for instance, music recommendations while the user is traveling by car should take into account the current traffic condition or the driver's mood. This requires the acquisition of ratings for items in several alternative contextual situations, to extract from this data the true dependency of the ratings on the contextual situation. In this paper, in order to simplify the in-context rating acquisition process, we consider the individual perceptions of the users about the influence of context on their decisions. We have elaborated a system design methodology where we assume that users can be requested to judge: a) if a contextual factor (e.g., the traffic state) is relevant for their decision making task, and b) how they would rate an item assuming that a certain contextual condition (e.g., traffic is chaotic) holds. Using these evaluations we show that it is possible to build an effective context-aware mobile recommender system. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Ten music therapists from six countries participated in the study. The themes that emerged from the data include moving from the ideal to the real world, shifting from the role of student to professional, confronting reality and working through challenges, and achieving personal growth and self-transformation. The dynamics of cross-cultural comparison, confronting the home culture, and redefining music therapy and professional identities within the local cultural context are illustrated via quotations from the participants.

Whereas, there have been a few studies on consumers' needs and preferences under their own contexts to accept recommender systems.

In this paper we consider a particular kind of context aware recommendation task - selecting music content that fits a place of interest (POI). To address this problem we have used emotional tags attached by a users' population to both music and POIs. Moreover, we have considered a set of similarity metrics for tagged resources to establish a match between music tracks and POIs. In order to test our hypothesis, i.e., that the users will reckon that a music track suits a POI when this track is selected by our approach, we have designed a live user experiment where subjects are repeatedly presented with POIs and a selection of music tracks, some of them matching the presented POI and some not. The results of the experiment show that there is a strong overlap between the users' selections and the best matching music that is recommended by the system for a POI. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Modeling temporal dynamics in user behavior is not trivial, and it is challenging to study its effect in order to provide better recommendation results to users. To incorporate temporal effects into information filtering systems, we analyze a large sized real-world usage log data gathered from Bugs Music, which is one of the well-known online music service in Korea, and study temporal dynamics in users' music listening behaviors considering periodicity of time dimension and popularity change. We insist that the result of our analysis can be a useful guideline to the industry which delivers music items to users and tries to consider temporal context in their recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

@article{han2009music,
abstract = {Context-based music recommendation is one of rapidly emerging applications in the advent of ubiquitous era and requires multidisciplinary efforts including low level feature extraction and music classification, human emotion description and prediction, ontology-based representation and recommendation, and the establishment of connections among them. In this paper, we contributed in three distinctive ways to take into account the idea of context awareness in the music recommendation field. Firstly, we propose a novel emotion state transition model (ESTM) to model human emotional states and their transitions by music. ESTM acts like a bridge between user situation information along with his/her emotion and low-level music features. With ESTM, we can recommend the most appropriate music to the user for transiting to the desired emotional state. Secondly, we present context-based music recommendation (COMUS) ontology for modeling user's musical preferences and context, and for supporting reasoning about the user's desired emotion and preferences. The COMUS is music-dedicated ontology in OWL constructed by incorporating domain-specific classes for music recommendation into the Music Ontology, which includes situation, mood, and musical features. Thirdly, for mapping low-level features to ESTM, we collected various high-dimensional music feature data and applied nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for their dimension reduction. We also used support vector machine (SVM) as emotional state transition classifier. We constructed a prototype music recommendation system based on these features and carried out various experiments to measure its performance. We report some of the experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Mobile devices such as smart phones are becoming popular, and realtime access to multimedia data in different environments is getting easier. With properly equipped communication services, users can easily obtain the widely distributed videos, music, and documents they want. Because of its usability and capacity requirements, music is more popular than other types of multimedia data. Documents and videos are difficult to view on mobile phones' small screens, and videos' large data size results in high overhead for retrieval. But advanced compression techniques for music reduce the required storage space significantly and make the circulation of music data easier. This means that users can capture their favorite music directly from the Web without going to music stores. Accordingly, helping users find music they like in a large archive has become an attractive but challenging issue over the past few years. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},
