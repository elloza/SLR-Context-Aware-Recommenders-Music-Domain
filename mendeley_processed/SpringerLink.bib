abstract = {In emotion-aware music recommender systems, the user's current emotion is identified and considered in recommending music to him. We have two motivations to extend the existing systems: (1) to the best of our knowledge, the current systems first estimate the user's emotions and then suggest music based on it. Therefore, the emotion estimation error affects the recommendation accuracy. (2) Studies show that the pattern of users' interactions with input devices can reflect their emotions. However, these patterns have not been used yet in emotion-aware music recommender systems. In this study, a music recommender system is proposed to suggest music based on users' keystrokes and mouse clicks patterns. Unlike the previous ones, the proposed system maps these patterns directly to the user's favorite music, without labeling its current emotion. The results show that even though this system does not use any additional device, it is highly accurate compared to previous methods.},

abstract = {To simplify effective music filtering, recommender systems (RS) have received great attention from both industry and academia area. To select which music to recommend, traditional RS uses an approximation of users' real interests. However, while discarding users' contexts, profiles information is not able to reflect their exact needs and to provide overpowering recommendations. One of the main issues that have to be considered before the conception of context-aware recommender systems (CARS) is the estimation of the relevance of contextual information. The use of irrelevant or superfluous contextual factors can generate serious problems about the complexity and the quality of recommendations. In this paper, we introduce a multi-dimensional context model for music CARS. We started by the acquisition of explicit items rating from a population in various possible contextual situations. Thus, we proposed a user-based methodology aiming to judge the relation between contextual factors and musical genres. Next, we applied the Multiple Linear Regression technique on users' perceived ratings, to define an order of importance between contextual dimensions. We described raw collected data with basic statistics about the created dataset. We also summarized the key results and discussed key findings. Finally, we propose a new framework for Music CARS.},

abstract = {In music recommender systems, automatic playlist continuation is an emerging task that aims to improve users' listening experience by recommending music in line with their musical taste. The typical approach towards this goal is to identify playlist characteristics by inspecting the existing tracks (i.e., seeds) in target playlists. However, seeds are not always available, especially when users create new playlists. For such cold-start situations, user-generated titles can be a good starting point to understand the intended purpose of users. This paper investigates the effectiveness of titles as an auxiliary data source for playlists suffering from the cold-start problem. Employing three naive recommendation models, we conduct experiments on one million music playlists from the Spotify platform. Our analyses show that the prevalent attitude in naming playlists results in highly accurate recommendations for playlists concerning a specific theme, such as albums, artists, and soundtracks. As the title space moves away from a particular theme, recommendation accuracy drops. Furthermore, the correlation between the common preference of a title and its usability in recommendation is quite weak; a title without a common sense may be useless in recommender systems, even though many users favor that title. Consequently, our findings serve as a guideline to develop title-aware recommendation approaches that can provide coherent continuations to the cold-start playlists.},

abstract = {Increasingly, music recommendations are influencing user listening behavior, which naturally impacts the music industry, as well as the cultural and social aspects of our society. This has opened up a research area, namely the identification of biases introduced by recommender systems in the music context. Recent research, which focused on users of the Last.fm platform found that state-of-the-art music recommendation systems frequently tend to favor already popular items. To this end, we propose a new method for predicting music recommendations, which relies on a cluster-based quotas system. By assuming the distribution of the popularity of artists to have a latent variable that is estimated with a Gaussian Mixture, we find the underlying popularity clusters and use them to make the predictions by quotas that relate to each cluster mixing proportion, in a way that the resulting popularity distribution in the recommendations is closer to the popularity distribution seen in the data. In our experiments with the Last.fm data, our final predictions increased the recommendation frequencies of less popular artists, while preserving the specific characteristics of each algorithm. The GAP(g)r and mean average error (MAE) metrics are improved, showing that our recommendations are more accurate and approximate to the expected popularity of the artists in each user profile.},

Thus natural material is processed, transformed into tones, sounds, noises, and systematized. This then serves as material for the second stage, the ‘crystallization' (see Chapter 6 ). These filtering processes repeat themselves, now already in the field of music, when chords are filtered out of heterophonic lines, and when in electroacoustic musical tones are worked out of noises or sine tones. The automated filtering by soft computing and FL-oriented methods is analysis of similarities. Our ‘leitmotif' BACH serves as a test for internet research, which shows the productivity of Fuzzy Logic. Filtering as highlighting essential information via the Phonographic Form supports the re-sharpening of the memory.

abstract = {Predicting emotions automatically is an active field of research in affective computing. Considering the property of the individual's subjectivity, the label of an emotional instance is usually created based on opinions from multiple annotators. That is, the labelled instance is often accompanied with the corresponding inter-rater disagreement information, which we call here the perception uncertainty. Such uncertainty information, as shown in previous studies, can provide supplementary information for better recognition performance in such a subjective task. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning framework to leverage the knowledge of perception uncertainty to ameliorate the prediction performance. In particular, in our novel framework, the perception uncertainty is exploited in an explicit manner to manipulate an initial prediction dynamically, in contrast to merely estimating the emotional state and perception uncertainty simultaneously, as done in a conventional multi-task learning framework. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform extensive experiments for time- and value-continuous emotion predictions in audiovisual conversation and music listening scenarios. Compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, our approach yields remarkable performance improvements in both datasets. The obtained results indicate that integrating the perception uncertainty information can enhance the learning process.},

To evaluate our objective, we implemented a recommender system into the Proactive Modeling Engine, which is an add-on for the Generic Modeling Environment. We then conducted experiments to subjectively and objectively evaluate enhancements to the Proactive Modeling Engine. The results of our experiments show that extending proactive modeling with a recommender system results in an average reciprocal hit-rank of 0.871. Likewise, the enhancements yield a System Usability Scale rating of 77. Finally, user feedback shows that integrating recommender systems into DSMLs increases usability and learnability.},

However, while music listeners interested in mainstream music are traditionally served well by music recommender systems, users interested in music beyond the mainstream (i.e., non-popular music) rarely receive relevant recommendations. In this paper, we study the characteristics of beyond-mainstream music and music listeners and analyze to what extent these characteristics impact the quality of music recommendations provided. Therefore, we create a novel dataset consisting of Last.fm listening histories of several thousand beyond-mainstream music listeners, which we enrich with additional metadata describing music tracks and music listeners. Our analysis of this dataset shows four subgroups within the group of beyond-mainstream music listeners that differ not only with respect to their preferred music but also with their demographic characteristics. Furthermore, we evaluate the quality of music recommendations that these subgroups are provided with four different recommendation algorithms where we find significant differences between the groups. Specifically, our results show a positive correlation between a subgroup's openness towards music listened to by members of other subgroups and recommendation accuracy. We believe that our findings provide valuable insights for developing improved user models and recommendation approaches to better serve beyond-mainstream music listeners.},

This paper proposes an improved music recommendation method based on bipartite graph link prediction with homogeneous nodes similarity. Firstly, users' music preference relations are expressed as positive and negative binary preference relations by the Complex Representation-based Link Prediction (CORLP) method, which improves the limitation of traditional recommendation method that can only represent unary preference relations. Secondly, the new method improves the CORLP method by attribute extraction and similarity calculation of homogeneous nodes including user nodes and music nodes. Thirdly, a new dataset based on the practical data from Shrimp Music Community is collected for facilitating the music recommendation task. The first-class music genres and second-class music genres of users are extracted by web crawling technology to calculate the similarity between user nodes. The rhythm and tempo are extracted by open source software to calculate the similarity between music nodes. Finally, the Top-N experiment is used to prove the performance of the proposed method compared with CORLP. In addition, the results reveal several new findings. Firstly, performance is significantly improved when the homogeneous nodes similarity is taken into account. Secondly, recommendation method with user nodes similarity shows a better performance compared with recommendation method with music nodes similarity.},

Through these efforts, a process for unfreezing the architecture in music has gradually been constructed. Initially, rhythm, texture, harmony, geometry, proportion and dynamics were considered as the basis of complimentary aural and visual formats used to evolve aural parameters and their corresponding visual parameters. These parameters, which are involved in both visual (architecture) and aural (music) formats form the logic used to decipher music from architecture and vice versa. Using scaled axes as a basis for both aural and visual parameters, a comparison emerged. Thus, aural parameters can be extracted from a grid (the visual parameters in the axes) to compose music as well as the reverse process—visual parameters can be extracted from the grid (the aural parameters in the axes) to arrive at an architectural design. This approach resulted in the development of logic.},

Today, much of the music that we listen to is organized in some form of a playlist, and many users of modern music platforms create playlists for themselves or to share them with others. The manual creation of such playlists can however be demanding, in particular due to the huge amount of possible tracks that are available online. To help users in this task, music platforms like Spotify provide users with interactive tools for playlist creation. These tools usually recommend additional songs to include given a playlist title or some initial tracks. Interestingly, little is known so far about the effects of providing such a recommendation functionality. We therefore conducted a user study involving 270 subjects, where one half of the participants—the treatment group—were provided with automated recommendations when performing a playlist construction task. We then analyzed to what extent such recommendations are adopted by users and how they influence their choices. Our results, among other aspects, show that about two thirds of the treatment group made active use of the recommendations. Further analyses provide additional insights about the underlying reasons why users selected certain recommendations. Finally, our study also reveals that the mere presence of the recommendations impacts the choices of the participants, even in cases when none of the recommendations was actually chosen.},

abstract = {One major shortcoming of traditional recommender systems is their inability to adjust to users' short-term preferences resulting from varying situation-specific factors. To address this, we propose the notion of situation-aware recommender systems, which are supposed to autonomously determine the users' current situation based on a multitude of contextual side information and generate truly personalized recommendations. In particular, we develop a situation awareness model for recommender systems, include it in a situation-aware recommendation process, and derive generic design steps for the design of situation-aware recommender systems. The feasibility of these concepts is demonstrated by directly employing them for the development and implementation of a music recommender system for everyday situations. Moreover, their meaningfulness is shown by means of an empirical user study. The outcomes of the evaluation indicate a significant increase in user satisfaction compared to traditional (i.e. non-situation-aware) recommendations.},

abstract = {Music recommender systems typically offer a “one-size-fits-all” approach with the same user controls and visualizations for all users. However, the effectiveness of interactive interfaces for music recommender systems is likely to be affected by individual differences. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive literature review of interactive interfaces in recommender systems to motivate the need for personalized interaction with music recommender systems, and two personal characteristics, visual memory and musical sophistication. More specifically, we studied the influence of these characteristics on the design of (a) visualizations for enhancing recommendation diversity and (b) the optimal level of user controls while minimizing cognitive load. The results of three experiments show a benefit for personalizing both visualization and control elements to musical sophistication. We found that (1) musical sophistication influenced the acceptance of recommendations for user controls. (2) musical sophistication also influenced recommendation acceptance, and perceived diversity for visualizations and the UI combining user controls and visualizations. However, musical sophistication only strengthens the impact of UI on perceived diversity (moderation effect) when studying the combined effect of controls and visualizations. These results allow us to extend the model for personalization in music recommender systems by providing guidelines for interactive visualization design for music recommender systems, with regard to both visualizations and user control.},

abstract = {Conversational Recommender Systems (CoRSs) implement a paradigm that allows users to interact in natural language with the system for defining their preferences and discovering items that best fit their needs. CoRSs can be straightforwardly implemented as chatbots that, nowadays, are becoming more and more popular for several applications, such as customer care, health care, and medical diagnoses. Chatbots implement an interaction based on natural language, buttons, or both. The implementation of a chatbot is a challenging task since it requires knowledge about natural language processing and human–computer interaction. A CoRS might be particularly useful in the music domain since music is generally enjoyed in contexts when a standard interface cannot be exploited (driving, doing homeworks, running). However, there is no work in the literature that analytically compares different interaction modes for a conversational music recommender system. In this paper, we focus on the design and implementation of a CoRS for the music domain. Our CoRS consists of different components. The system implements content-based recommendation, critiquing and adaptive strategies, as well as explanation facilities. The main innovative contribution is that the user can interact through different interaction modes: natural language, buttons, and mixed. Due to the lack of available datasets for testing CoRSs, we carried out an in vivo experimental evaluation with the goal of investigating the impact of the different interaction modes on the recommendation accuracy and on the cost of interaction for the final user. The experiment involved 110 people, and 54 completed the whole process. The analysis of the results shows that the best interaction mode is based on a mixed strategy that combines buttons and natural language. In addition, the results allow to clearly understand which are the steps in the dialog that are particularly strenuous for the user.},

abstract = {Inspired by the success of deploying deep learning in the fields of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, this learning paradigm has also found its way into the field of Music Information Retrieval. In order to benefit from deep learning in an effective, but also efficient manner, deep transfer learning has become a common approach. In this approach, it is possible to reuse the output of a pre-trained neural network as the basis for a new learning task. The underlying hypothesis is that if the initial and new learning tasks show commonalities and are applied to the same type of input data (e.g., music audio), the generated deep representation of the data is also informative for the new task. Since, however, most of the networks used to generate deep representations are trained using a single initial learning source, their representation is unlikely to be informative for all possible future tasks. In this paper, we present the results of our investigation of what are the most important factors to generate deep representations for the data and learning tasks in the music domain. We conducted this investigation via an extensive empirical study that involves multiple learning sources, as well as multiple deep learning architectures with varying levels of information sharing between sources, in order to learn music representations. We then validate these representations considering multiple target datasets for evaluation. The results of our experiments yield several insights into how to approach the design of methods for learning widely deployable deep data representations in the music domain.},

Most of the existing sequence recommendation methods focus on how to use the items' attributes to characterize the user's preferences, ignoring that the user behavior also can reflect the preference for items. However, user behavior often has problems of mis-interaction and random interaction, which leads to fully utilizing it difficultly. Therefore, this paper proposes a new Behavior-Item based Hybrid Intent-aware Framework (BIHIF). In this framework, the user's main intent is extracted based on user behaviors and interactive items, respectively, the two intent vectors are combined and extracted by the full connection layer to obtain the user's real intent. We use real intent and item vector to calculate the score of the candidate items and make Top-K recommendations. Based on the framework, we implement models respectively by MLP and GRU, which show good results in the experiments based on three real-world datasets.},

In this paper, we present a detailed study of the diversity in recommender systems to help researchers in the development of recommendation approaches to generate efficient recommendations. We have also analyzed the existing works for assessment of impact and quality of diversified recommendations. Based on our detailed investigation of the diversity in recommendations, we shift the generic focus from accuracy objectives to explore beyond the accuracy of recommendations. The need for recommender systems producing diversified recommendations without compromising the accuracy is very high to meet the growing demands of users. To address the personalization problem in travel recommender systems, we present the hybrid swarm intelligence clustering ensemble-based recommendation framework to generate diverse and accurate Point of Interest recommendations. Our proposed recommendation approach employs multiple swarm optimization algorithms to frame a clustering ensemble for the generation of efficient user clustering. We have evaluated our proposed recommendation approach over a real-time large-scale dataset of TripAdvisor to estimate the quality of recommendations in terms of diversity and accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the enhanced efficiency of the proposed recommendation approach over state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have greatly evolved in recent years and have become an integral part of the Web. From e-commerce sites to mobile apps, our daily routine revolves around a series of “small” decisions that are influenced by such recommendations. In a similar manner, online social networks recommend only a subset of the massive amount of content published by a user's friends. However, the prevalent approach for the content selection process in such systems is driven by the amount of interaction between the user and the friend who published the content. As a result, content of interest is often lost due to weak social ties. In this paper, we present a fine-grained recommender system for social ecosystems, designed to recommend media content (e.g., music videos, online clips) published by the user's friends. The system design was driven by the findings of our qualitative user study that explored the value and requirements of a recommendation component within a social network. The core idea behind the proposed approach was to leverage the abundance of preexisting information in each user's account for creating interest profiles, to calculate similarity scores at a fine-grained level for each friend. The intuition behind the proposed method was to find consistent ways to obtain information representations that can identify overlapping interests in very specific sub-categories (e.g., two users' music preferences may only coincide on hard rock). While the system is intended as a component of the social networking service, we developed a proof-of-concept implementation for Facebook and explored the effectiveness of our underlying mechanisms for content analysis. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, as the recommended content of interest was both overlooked by the existing Facebook engine and not contained in the users' Facebook News Feed. We also conducted a user study for exploring the usability aspects of the prototype and found that it offers functionality that could significantly improve user experience in popular services.},

These difficulties are intensified when continuous control problems have to be tackled or when the actuation must vary continually subject to the sensor inputs. Such is the case in day-lighting or occupancy-based control applications. In this paper, we propose a declarative high-level Domain-Specific Language that aims to reduce the effort required to specify the control logic of building automation systems. Our language combines fuzzy logic and temporal logic, enabling to define the behaviour in terms of domain abstractions. Finally, the approach has been validated in two ways: (i) in a case study that simulates the control system of an automated office room and (ii) by means of an empirical study to confirm usability (with a System Usability Scale questionnaire) and effectiveness, here regarded from the perspective of correctness, of the proposed language with respect to a well-known language like Simulink.},

However, in addition to gathering information about users' tastes, there is an additional aspect that can be relevant for a proper codification strategy, namely the order in which the user interacted with the items. In this paper, several encoding strategies based on neural networks are analyzed and applied to solve two different recommendation tasks in the context of music playlists. The results show that the order in which the musical pieces were listened to is relevant for the codification of items (songs). We also find that the encoding of user profiles should use a different amount of historical data depending on the learning task to be solved. In other words, we do not always have to use all the available data; sometimes, it is better to discard old information, as tastes change over time.},

Thus, in order to investigate whether personalization plays a vital role in this context, more specifically in relaxation, we: (i) analyze more than 60 thousand playlists created by more than 5 thousand users from the 8tracks platform; (ii) extract high and low-level features from the songs of these playlists; (iii) create a user perception based on these features; (iv) identify users groups by their perceptions; (v) analyze the contrasts between these groups, comparing their most relevant features.

Robotic musicianship has evolved from isolated novelty to a growing field of research with audience-inspiring outcomes (Hoffman and Weinberg in Auton Robot 31(2–3):133–153, [1]). Between 2002 and 2017 the number of members in the International Society for Music Information Retrieval has grown from about 500 to well over 2000 (https://www.ismir.net/stats.php ). As the field of artificial intelligence for music-related tasks continues to grow, so grows the need for better, more robust learning systems that are able to more deeply understand people's responses, preferences, and intentions to music. Such learning systems are not only valuable in the specific contexts in which understanding music, and human psychology with respect to music, is valuable, but also has broader implications regarding learning systems in general. From reasoning about implicit mental states in human counterparts and how they are affected by surrounding stimuli, to temporal adaptation to changing preferences and circumstances, to online context-aware recommendation, music serves as an excellent testbed for a wider, broader array of more general questions involving continual learning, system adaptation, and social agents.},

abstract = {This is an extension from a selected paper from JSAI2019. This paper proposes a method for recommending music items considering listeners' context information. Recently, users can enjoy music easily regardless of time and a place due to evolution of online music services such as Spotify. However, it is difficult for us to find appropriate music items from enormous resources. On the other hand, because of listening style and characteristic of music items, music items do not usually have explicit rating. Therefore, implicit feedback such as playing count has been widely used to construct recommender systems. As additional information, this paper considers listeners' context. The proposed method employs FMs (Factorization Machines), in which the context information is treated as factors. Negative sampling is applied to reduce the number of negative samples (music items a user has yet to be listened). The effectiveness of the proposed method and the effect of negative sampling are evaluated with an offline experiment.

abstract = {In the last decade, music consumption has changed dramatically as humans have increasingly started to use music streaming platforms. While such platforms provide access to millions of songs, the sheer volume of choices available renders it hard for users to find songs they like. Consequently, the task of finding music the user likes is often mitigated by music recommender systems, which aim to provide recommendations that match the user's current context. Particularly in the field of music recommendation, adapting recommendations to the user's current context is critical as, throughout the day, users listen to different music in numerous different contexts and situations. Therefore, we propose a multi-context-aware user model and track recommender system that jointly exploit information about the current situation and musical preferences of users. Our proposed system clusters users based on their situational context features and similarly, clusters music tracks based on their content features. By conducting a series of offline experiments, we show that by relying on Factorization Machines for the computation of recommendations, the proposed multi-context-aware user model successfully leverages interaction effects between user listening histories, situational, and track content information, substantially outperforming a set of baseline recommender systems.},

abstract = {Music has emerged to be of paramount importance to humanity and is not only considered as a source of entertainment but also an agent that causes social and psychological influences. A large number of existing digital music libraries have improved awareness among people through the music recommendation approach. However, several critical technical challenges still require attention and must be well–addressed to provide a reliable recommendation to music listeners. In Indian Classical Music, Raga is composed of coalescing diverse musical note structures. The history of classical music unveils that every raga possesses some distinct sessions. With a vast collection of classical music files in online music libraries, locating and listening to classical music is no more a difficult task. However, searching and listening to the audio of one's preference may not be simple as it must instinctively satisfy the listener's preference in a precise session. In this paper, a system termed as iMusic has been proposed to classify, analyze, and recommend the session–sensitive performance of Indian classical music by analyzing the musical note structures followed by features matching. Available note-patterns in the raga performance have been illustrated using a deep neural network and a set of machine learning algorithms where raga samples have been represented as inputs in the projected network and are classified based on the performing sessions. A context-aware k-means clustering algorithm has also been illustrated, entitled as a data filtering algorithm. The proficiency of the filtering algorithm has been established in two ways. Primarily, as a data-sensitive analysis, and second as empirical studies on synthetically obtained real classical music dataset (https://github.com/SamarjitRoy89/iMusic.git) to put on the hybrid music recommendation. In this work, a case-study of session-sensitive Indian music recommender system has been demonstrated using key-strategies viz. listener modelling, representation learning, and music profiling. Eventually, several evaluation metrics have been discussed to characterize the effectiveness of proposed representation learning-based playing session-sensitive music recommendation strategies. The proposed iMusic system renders data classification accuracy of $\sim$ 88%. Such a framework could provide a useful basis regarding studies on hybrid music recommendation systems based on the usefulness of end-users.},

Considering millions of songs available in online streaming services, it is difficult to identify the most suitable song for an emotion of a user.

Those systems are unable to address the cold start problem and rating diversity. Furthermore, song preferences will be altering based on the current mood of the users. If these problems were not addressed, then these online services will fail to achieve user satisfaction. To cope with those problems, this paper proposes a novel music recommendation approach that utilizes social media content such as posts, comments, interactions, etc. and recommend them with the most relevant songs to relax their mind considering the current mood (happy, sad, calm and angry). The current mood and the preferences are extracted from the social media profile of the users. Then the songs were classified to moods based on the lyrics and audio of the songs.},

The recent work of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of movie recommendations has shown that this popularity bias leads to unfair treatment of both long-tail items as well as users with little interest in popular items. In this paper, we reproduce the analyses of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of music recommendation. Specifically, we investigate three user groups from the Last.fm music platform that are categorized based on how much their listening preferences deviate from the most popular music among all Last.fm users in the dataset: (i) low-mainstream users, (ii) medium-mainstream users, and (iii) high-mainstream users. In line with Abdollahpouri et al., we find that state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms favor popular items also in the music domain. However, their proposed Group Average Popularity metric yields different results for Last.fm than for the movie domain, presumably due to the larger number of available items (i.e., music artists) in the Last.fm dataset we use. Finally, we compare the accuracy results of the recommendation algorithms for the three user groups and find that the low-mainstreaminess group significantly receives the worst recommendations.},

Considering the above problem, this paper proposes a music recommendation method by considering both users' current states and their historical behaviors. First, a feature selection process based on ReliefF method is applied to discover the optimal features for the following recommendation. Second, we construct different feature groups according to the feature weights and introduce Naive Bayes model and Adaboost algorithm to train these feature groups, which will output a base classifier for each feature group. Finally, a majority voting strategy decides the optimal music type and each user will be recommended more suitable music based on their current context.

abstract = {The availability of increasingly larger multimedia collections has fostered extensive research in recommender systems. Instead of capturing general user preferences, the task of next-item recommendation focuses on revealing specific session preferences encoded in the most recent user interactions. This study focuses on the music domain, particularly on the task of music playlist continuation, a paradigmatic case of next-item recommendation. While the accuracy achieved in next-song recommendations is important, in this work we shift our focus toward a deeper understanding of fundamental playlist characteristics, namely the song order, the song context and the song popularity, and their relation to the recommendation of playlist continuations. We also propose an approach to assess the quality of the recommendations that mitigates known problems of off-line experiments for music recommender systems. Our results indicate that knowing a longer song context has a positive impact on next-song recommendations. We find that the long-tailed nature of the playlist datasets makes simple and highly expressive playlist models appear to perform comparably, but further analysis reveals the advantage of using highly expressive models. Finally, our experiments suggest that the song order is not crucial to accurately predict next-song recommendations.},

abstract = {Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARS) focus on the improvement of accuracy and user's satisfaction by incorporating context features while making recommendations. Using too many context features aggravate the data sparsity problem and may impair predictive performance while few context features fail to capture the contextual effects. Though genre-based ratings called implicit ratings play an important role while making recommendations, despite that most of the studies have focused on utilizing explicit ratings. Addressing these issues, we propose a novel framework that demonstrates multiple rating prediction algorithms based on user neighborhood and item neighborhood approaches exploiting explicit and implicit ratings. The algorithms incorporate context communities to alleviate the data sparsity problem. We have also used weighted percentile method to increase the precision. Furthermore, we extended our research to Group Recommendations to see the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Finally, the results using two datasets indicate that the proposed context-aware weighted percentile algorithms are superior than the baseline approaches. The item neighborhood-based approaches are more accurate than user neighborhood-based approaches and the performance of explicit and implicit ratings are dataset dependent. The results obtained also prove the effectiveness of the algorithms for Group Recommendations.},

abstract = {With the recent rise in popularity of social networks, millions of users have included social network Web sites into their daily lives. Traditional social recommendation systems suggest items with high popularity, familiarity, and similarity to users. Such recommendation processes might encounter two problems: (1) if the recommended item is very popular, the target user may already be familiar with it; (2) the target user may not be interested in items recommended by users familiar to them. To improve upon traditional recommendation systems, we propose a SPUBI algorithm to discover unknown but interesting items for users using social penetration phenomenon. SPUBI considers the popularity of items, familiarity of other users, similarity of users, users interests and categories, and item freshness to obtain a social penetration score, which are used to generate a recommendation list to the target user. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SPUBI algorithm can provide a satisfactory recommendation list while discovering unknown but interesting items effectively.},

abstract = {Harmonizing the style of all the furniture placed within a constrained space/scene is an important principle for interior design. In this paper, we propose a furniture style compatibility recommendation approach for users to create a harmonic 3D virtual scene based on 2D furniture photos. Most previous works of 3D model style analysis measure the style similarity or compatibility based on predefined geometric features extracted from 3D models. However, “style” is a high-level semantic concept, which is difficult to be described explicitly by hand-crafted geometric features. Moreover, analyzing the style compatibility between two or more furniture belonging to different classes (e.g., table and lamp) is much more challenging since the given furniture may have very distinctive structures or geometric elements. Recently, deep neural network has been claimed to have more powerful ability to mimic the perception of human visual cortex, and therefore we propose to analyze style compatibility between 3D furniture models of different classes based on a Cross-Class Triplet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We conducted experiments based on a collected dataset containing 420 textured 3D furniture models. A group of raters were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to evaluate the comparative suitability of paired models within the dataset. The experimental results reveal that the proposed furniture style compatibility method based on deep learning performs better than the state-of-the-art method and can be used to efficiently generate harmonic virtual scenes.},

As a result, they are able to recommend relevant pieces of information to the users at just the right time and even before they explicitly ask (e.g., before submitting a query).

Moreover, our proposed model is capable of not only predicting the near-future topics of interest but also predicting an approximate time of the day when a user would be interested in a given search topic.},

The results showed that highly conscientious users paid significantly more attention to ORG, evaluated slightly more products, and placed more fixations on each product in the ORG. Whereas, low conscientiousness users exhibited more fixations on the LIST interface.

Even though performance evaluation is dominated by accuracy-related metrics – such as precision or NDCG –, other properties of the recommended items like their novelty and diversity have attracted attention in recent years, where several metrics have been defined with this goal in mind. However, it is unclear how suitable these metrics are to measure novelty or diversity in temporal contexts. In this paper, we propose a formulation to capture the time-aware novelty (or freshness) of the recommendation lists, according to different time models of the items. Hence, we provide a measure to account for how much a system is promoting fresh items in its recommendations. We show that time-aware recommenders tend to provide more fresh items, although this is not always the case, depending on statistical biases and patterns inherent to the data. Our results, nonetheless, indicate that the proposed formulation can be used to extend the knowledge about what items are being suggested by any recommendation technique aiming to exploit temporal contexts.},

These online spaces thrive with multifaceted activities and interests which give rise to rich content and user interaction that often crossover to the world of events. For these reasons, the data trails associated with “events” in the virtual world can be complex and challenging to understand and predict. This paper presents our efforts to build an interpretable framework to analyze event data and recommend relevant events to social media users with different preferences. The datasets for this challenge were provided by a competition on Kaggle. We conduct an extensive data analysis and exploration to help gain a better understanding of the data. We then proceed to the critical phase of feature engineering, storytelling and modeling for computing event recommendations. We explore fuzzy approximate reasoning for modeling because of its rich linguistic expression ability which allows handling uncertainty, while maintaining human interpretability of the built models and predictions. This interpretability is critical in the data mining enterprise because data mining often requires team collaboration and yields results that need to be consumed by people of diverse technical and non-technical background. Such teams tend to question the meaning of models and emphasize the importance of telling stories from the data. We evaluate our event recommendation system on a real-world dataset with more than one million events and 38,000 users. The proposed methodology achieved 70% accuracy, outperforming existing event recommendation algorithms.},

The analysis of real-world data sets demonstrates strong item consumption patterns in the degree of order. In this paper, we propose a novel method to tackle the right-order recommendation problem based on a graph structure that incorporates the item consumption orders. The proposed method can combine relevance and order effects in recommendations. We attempt to recommend the relevant items in the consecutive steps within a user session so that the user's selected items in the consecutive steps can be stringed together in a right order. The experimental evaluation conducted on three real-world data sets shows that the recommendation accuracy is improved by considering item consumption orders compared with the baseline recommendation methods.

Specifically, the proposed approach first learns music pieces' embeddings (feature vectors in low-dimension continuous space) from music listening records and corresponding metadata.

Specifically, the proposed approach first learns the low dimensional representations of music pieces from users' music listening sequences using neural network models. Based on the learned representations, it then infers and models users' general and contextual preferences for music from users' historical listening records. Finally, music pieces in accordance with user's preferences are recommended to the target user. Extensive experiments are conducted on real world datasets to compare the proposed method with other state-of-the-art recommendation methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms those baselines, especially on sparse data.},

abstract = {Music recommendation is a critical technology enabling users to overcome the overload of songs in the music sites. Although existing methods of similar retrieval or sequence prediction have attained success to some extend, one important factor has not been considered in the previous work, that is, users may change their music interest in different sessions. How to define the users' current interest is still a problem. In this paper, we propose a topic-based probabilistic model for addressing this problem by developing session-aware latent topics to model the users' listening behavior. The model is designed based on the insight that users' listening behavior is subjected to not only their personal interest, but also to their special interest in the session. Specifically, when making recommendation, our model estimates the probability of the song selection based on the mixture of the two aspects with a weight-based scheme. We have conducted experiments on a real music dataset from Last.fm. The empirical results demonstrate that our model performs much better than other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Music recommender systems is an important field of research because of easy availability and use of online music. The most existing models only focus on explicit data like ratings and other user-item dimensions. A challenging problem in music recommendation is to model a variety of contextual information, such as feedback, time and location. In this article, we proposed a competent hybrid music recommender system (HMRS), which works on context and collaborative approaches. The timestamp is extracted from users listening log to construct a decision context behavior that extracted various temporal features like a week, sessions(as morning, evening or night). We used depth-first-search (DFS) algorithm which traverses the whole graph through the paths in different contexts. Bellman-Ford algorithm provides ranked list of recommended items with multi-layer context graph. We enhanced the process using particle swarm optimization (PSO) which produced highly optimized results. The dataset is used from Last.fm which contains 19,150,868 music listening logs of 992 users (till May, 4th 2009). We extract the properties of music from user's listening history and evaluate the efficient system to recommend music based on user's contextual preferences. Our system noticeably delivers the best recommendations regarding recall results when compared to existing methods.},

The expertise level of users is inferred from the frequency analysis of their tags by using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which is an indicator of the quantity and relevance of the tags that users provide to items.

Although people listen to music in a context-driven manner, music recommendation services typically ignore where a user is listening to the music. They also typically select music based on a single seed song, rather than ordering a user's created playlists for the best user experience. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) We present a survey of 15 DJs of college radio stations to identify their heuristics in creating playlists for radio shows. (2) We present an experimental study design to evaluate various scheduling (track ordering) strategies for mobile music consumption in situ, which is used to (3) conduct a field experiment that compares the user experience of three scheduling strategies (tempo, genre and location) against the gold standard of a playlist created by an experienced DJ (This work was completed when Anupriya Ankolekar and Thomas Sandholm were both researchers, and Louis Lei Yu was a postdoctoral research fellow at Hewlett Packard Labs.

Despite its increasing popularity, MOOCs still suffer from the problem of high drop-out rate. One important reason may be due to the difficulty in understanding learning demand and user interests. To helper users find the most suitable courses, personalized course recommendation technology has become a hot research topic in e-learning and data mining community. One of the keys to the success of personalized course recommendation is a good user modeling method. Previous works in course recommendation often focus on developing user modeling methodology which learns latent user interests from historic learning data. Recently, interactive course recommendation has become more and more popular. In this paradigm, recommender systems can directly query user interests through survey tables or questionnaires and thus the learned interests may be more accurate. In this paper, we study the user interest acquisition problem based on the interactive course recommendation framework (ICRF). Under this framework, we systematically discuss different settings on querying user interests. To reduce performance-cost score, we propose the ICRF user interest acquisition algorithm that combines representative sampling and interest propagation algorithm to acquire user interests in a cost-effective way. With extensive experiments on real-world MOOC course enrollment datasets, we empirically demonstrate that our selective acquisition strategy is very effective and it can reduce the performance-cost score by 30.25% compared to the traditional aggressive acquisition strategies.},

abstract = {Recommender systems as one of the most efficient information filtering techniques have been widely studied in recent years. However, traditional recommender systems only utilize user-item rating matrix for recommendations, and the social connections and item sequential patterns are ignored. But in our real life, we always turn to our friends for recommendations, and often select the items that have similar sequential patterns. In order to overcome these challenges, many studies have taken social connections and sequential information into account to enhance recommender systems. Although these existing studies have achieved good results, most of them regard social influence and sequential information as regularization terms, and the deep structure hidden in social networks and rating patterns has not been fully explored. On the other hand, neural network based embedding methods have shown their power in many recommendation tasks with their ability to extract high-level representations from raw data. Motivated by the above observations, we take the advantage of network embedding techniques and propose an embedding-based recommendation method, which is composed of the embedding model and the collaborative filtering model. Specifically, to exploit the deep structure hidden in social networks and rating patterns, a neural network based embedding model is first pre-trained, where the external user and item representations are extracted. Then, we incorporate these extracted factors into a collaborative filtering model by fusing them with latent factors linearly, where our method not only can leverage the external information to enhance recommendation, but also can exploit the advantage of collaborative filtering techniques. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and the importance of these external extracted factors.},

One key to the success of such systems lies in the precise acquisition or estimation of the user's preferences. While general recommender systems research often relies on the existence of explicit preference statements for personalization, such information is often very sparse or unavailable in real-world applications. Information that allows us to assess the relevance of certain items indirectly through a user's actions and behavior (implicit feedback) is in contrast often available in abundance. In this chapter we categorize different types of implicit feedback and review their use in the context of recommender systems and Social Information Access applications. We then extend the categorization scheme to be suitable to recent application domains. Finally, we present state-of-the-art algorithmic approaches, discuss challenges when using implicit feedback signals in particular with respect to popularity biases, and discuss selected recent works from the literature.},

abstract = {Practitioners often face ill-structured problems. However, it is difficult for instructors to assess their students' work on such problems, as a broad set of solutions exist and may depend on the context. One way to assess student learning is through the evaluation of their mental models, which can be presented in the form of a causal network or ‘map'. While comparing a student's map to an expert's map can assist with the evaluation, this is a challenging process, in part, due to variations in language, resulting in the use of different terms for the same construct. The first step of the comparison is to address these variations by aligning as many of the students' terms with their equivalent in the expert's map. We present the design and implementation of a software to assist with the alignment task. The software improves on previous work by optimizing usability (e.g., minimizing the number of clicks to create an alignment) and by leveraging previous alignments to recommend new ones. In addition, alignments can be done collaboratively, as our system is available online: one instructor can invite others to edit or see the alignments. Further improvements to this system may be achieved using content-based recommender systems or natural language processing.},

To this end, in this paper, we conduct a survey of these recent advances on recommender systems from the perspective of the explicit item relation understanding. We organize these relevant studies from three types of item relations, i.e., combination-effect relations, sequence-dependence relations, and external-constraint relations. Specifically, the combination-effect relation and the sequence-dependence relation based work models the intra-group intrinsic relations of items from the user demand perspective, and the external-constraint relation emphasizes the external requirements for items. After that, we also propose our opinions on the open issues along the line of understanding item relations and suggest some future research directions in recommendation area.},

This is a family of systems that includes recommender systems, which is one of the most successful classes of advice-giving software in practice. We investigate the purposes of explanations as well as how they are generated, presented to users, and evaluated. As a result, we derive a novel comprehensive taxonomy of aspects to be considered when designing explanation facilities for current and future decision support systems. The taxonomy includes a variety of different facets, such as explanation objective, responsiveness, content and presentation. Moreover, we identified several challenges that remain unaddressed so far, for example related to fine-grained issues associated with the presentation of explanations and how explanation facilities are evaluated.},

Considering the high correlation between music, mood and driving comfort and safety, it makes sense to use appropriate and intelligent music recommendations based on the mood of drivers and songs in the context of car driving. The objective of this paper is to present the project of a contextual moodbased music recommender system capable of regulating the driver's mood and trying to have a positive influence on her driving behaviour. Here we present the proof of concept of the system and describe the techniques and technologies that are part of it. Further possible future improvements on each of the building blocks are also presented.},

abstract = {Smart vehicles form pervasive environment to enhance user experience through multimedia enabled infotainment systems. In order to realize effective infotainment system for vehicles, we need to have context-aware applications that use latest (live) information for enhanced user experience. Such latest information is abundantly available on the Internet due to explosive growth of Web 3.0, which can be accessed through wireless communication infrastructures such as VANETs and LTE. In this paper we propose a cloud-based middleware framework, InCloud, for vehicular infotainment application development. The proposed framework follows service oriented architecture in which data filtering and fusion functionalities are delegated to the cloud. Data filtering and fusion reduce the data flow over wireless link. Furthermore, because most of the processing is done on the cloud, the client becomes lightweight and loosely coupled with Internet resources and underlying platforms in vehicles. We also propose a class-based fusion method for combining information from multiple resources on the Internet. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated by developing three infotainment applications for vehicles: context-aware music, news, and an enhanced Direction (eDirection) application.},

First of all, seven representative graphical models associated with tag contents are reviewed and evaluated in terms of effectiveness in achieving their goals. The models are explored in depth based on appropriate plate notations for the tag-based document retrieval. Second, well-established review criteria for two-way classical methods, tag refinement and tag recommendation, are utilized for tag-based image retrieval. In particular, tag refinement methods are analyzed by means of the experimental results measured on different datasets. Last, popular tagging methods in the area of music information retrieval are reviewed for the tag-based music information retrieval. We introduce five criteria: used models, tagging purpose, tagging right, object type, and used dataset, for evaluating tag-based information retrieval methods as a new categorical framework engaging the graphical models as well as the two-way classical methods.},

abstract = {In microblogs, authors use hashtags to mark keywords or topics. These manually labeled tags can be used to benefit various live social media applications (e.g., microblog retrieval, classification). However, because only a small portion of microblogs contain hashtags, recommending hashtags for use in microblogs are a worthwhile exercise. In addition, human inference often relies on the intrinsic grouping of words into phrases. However, existing work uses only unigrams to model corpora. In this work, we propose a novel phrase-based topical translation model to address this problem. We use the bag-of-phrases model to better capture the underlying topics of posted microblogs. We regard the phrases and hashtags in a microblog as two different languages that are talking about the same thing. Thus, the hashtag recommendation task can be viewed as a translation process from phrases to hashtags. To handle the topical information of microblogs, the proposed model regards translation probability as being topic specific. We test the methods on data collected from realworld microblogging services. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods that use the unigram model.},

Within this context, there is an extensive ongoing research about understanding the semantics (i.e., facts) such as objects or events in videos. However, little research has been devoted to understanding the emotional content of the videos. In this paper, we address this issue and introduce a system that performs emotional content analysis of professionally edited and user-generated videos. We concentrate both on the representation and modeling aspects. Videos are represented using mid-level audio-visual features. More specifically, audio and static visual representations are automatically learned from raw data using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In addition, dense trajectory based motion and SentiBank domain-specific features are incorporated. By means of ensemble learning and fusion mechanisms, videos are classified into one of predefined emotion categories. Results obtained on the VideoEmotion dataset and a subset of the DEAP dataset show that (1) higher level representations perform better than low-level features, (2) among audio features, mid-level learned representations perform better than mid-level handcrafted ones, (3) incorporating motion and domain-specific information leads to a notable performance gain, and (4) ensemble learning is superior to multi-class support vector machines (SVMs) for video affective content analysis.},

We furthermore provide an extensive statistical analysis of the dataset, including basic properties of the item sets, demographic coverage, distribution of listening events (e.g., over artists and users), and aspects related to music preference and consumption behavior (e.g., temporal features and mainstreaminess of listeners). Exploiting country information of users and genre tags of artists, we also create taste profiles for populations and determine similar and dissimilar countries in terms of their populations' music preferences. Finally, we illustrate the dataset's usage in a simple artist recommendation task, whose results are intended to serve as baseline against which more elaborate techniques can be assessed.},

Consequently, many research efforts have been put on location-aware news recommendation; the explored approaches can mainly be divided into physical distance-based and geographical topicbased ones. As for geographical topic-based location-aware news recommendation, ELSA is the state-of-the-art geographical topic model: it has been reported to outperform many other topic models, e.g., BOW, LDA, and ESA. However, the Wikipedia-based topic space in ELSA suffers from the problems of high dimensionality, sparsity, and redundancy, which greatly degrade the recommendation performance of ELSA. Therefore, to overcome these problems, in this work, we propose three novel geographical topic feature models, CLSA, ALSA, and DLSA, which integrate clustering, autoencoders, and recommendation-oriented deep neural networks, respectively, with ELSA to extract dense, abstract, low dimensional, and effective topic features from the Wikipedia-based topic space for the representation of news and locations. Experimental results show that (i) CLSA, ALSA, and DLSA all greatly outperform the stateof-the-art geographical topic model, ELSA, in location-aware news recommendation in terms of both the recommendation effectiveness and efficiency; (ii) Deep Localized Semantic Analysis (DLSA) achieves the most significant improvements: its precision, recall, MRR, and MAP are all about 3 times better than those of ELSA; while its recommendation time-cost is only about 1/29 of that of ELSA; and (iii) DLSA, ALSA, and CLSA can also remedy the “cold-start” problem by uncovering users' latent news preferences at new locations.},

To solve this challenging task, our approach exploits the correlation between the audio and visual modalities in video collections. A major difficulty is the high amount of uncorrelated audio in the videos, i.e., audio that does not correspond to the main image content, such as voice-over, background music, added sound effects, or sounds originating off-screen. We present an unsupervised, clustering-based solution that is able to automatically separate correlated sounds from uncorrelated ones. The core algorithm is based on a joint audio-visual feature space, in which we perform iterated mutual kNN clustering in order to effectively filter out uncorrelated sounds. To this end we also introduce a new dataset of correlated audio-visual data, on which we evaluate our approach and compare it to alternative solutions.

We used user generated tag data from Last.fm to produce 23 subgraphs of each network based on tag categories representing musical genre, mood, and gender of vocalist. We analyzed these subgraphs to determine how recommendations within each network tend to stay within tag categories. Finally, we compared the lyrical recommendations to the collaborative filtering recommendations to determine how well lyrical recommendations perform.

First, we propose a framework, called RecAm, which enables the collection of contextual information and the delivery of resulted recommendation by adapting the user's environment using Ambient Intelligent (AmI) Interfaces. Second, we propose a recommendation model that establishes a bridge between the multimedia resources, user joint preferences, and the detected contextual information. Hence, we obtain a comprehensive view of the user's context, as well as provide a personalized environment to deliver the feedback. We demonstrate the feasibility of RecAm with two prototypes applications that use contextual information for recommendations.

abstract = {Traditional recommender systems provide personal suggestions based on the user's preferences, without taking into account any additional contextual information, such as time or device type. The added value of contextual information for the recommendation process is highly dependent on the application domain, the type of contextual information, and variations in users' usage behavior in different contextual situations. This paper investigates whether users utilize a mobile news service in different contextual situations and whether the context has an influence on their consumption behavior. Furthermore, the importance of context for the recommendation process is investigated by comparing the user satisfaction with recommendations based on an explicit static profile, content-based recommendations using the actual user behavior but ignoring the context, and context-aware content-based recommendations incorporating user behavior as well as context. Considering the recommendations based on the static profile as a reference condition, the results indicate a significant improvement for recommendations that are based on the actual user behavior. This improvement is due to the discrepancy between explicitly stated preferences (initial profile) and the actual consumption behavior of the user. The context-aware content-based recommendations did not significantly outperform the content-based recommendations in our user study. Context-aware content-based recommendations may induce a higher user satisfaction after a longer period of service operation, enabling the recommender to overcome the cold-start problem and distinguish user preferences in various contextual situations.},

abstract = {Implicit feedback-based recommendation problems, typically set in real-world applications, recently have been receiving more attention in the research community. From the practical point of view, scalability of such methods is crucial. However, factorization-based algorithms efficient in explicit rating data applied directly to implicit data are computationally inefficient; therefore, different techniques are needed to adapt to implicit feedback. For alternating least squares (ALS) learning, several research contributions have proposed efficient adaptation techniques for implicit feedback. These algorithms scale linearly with the number of nonzero data points, but cubically in the number of features, which is a computational bottleneck that prevents the efficient usage of accurate high factor models. Also, map-reduce type big data techniques are not viable with ALS learning, because there is no known technique that solves the high communication overhead required for random access of the feature matrices. To overcome this drawback, here we present two generic approximate variants for fast ALS learning, using conjugate gradient (CG) and coordinate descent (CD). Both CG and CD can be coupled with all methods using ALS learning. We demonstrate the advantages of fast ALS variants on iTALS, a generic context-aware algorithm, which applies ALS learning for tensor factorization on implicit data. In the experiments, we compare the approximate techniques with the base ALS learning in terms of training time, scalability, recommendation accuracy, and convergence. We show that the proposed solutions offer a trade-off between recommendation accuracy and speed of training time; this makes it possible to apply ALS-based methods efficiently even for billions of data points.},

Then, the scheme conducts prediction of TV show popularity for different regions based on the profile and similar shows. For a new TV show, the popularity of the similar shows is utilized to get the initial location-show matrix. Then, the location profiles and physical distance are used as regularizer into the collaborative filtering framework to further refine the prediction.

The survey essentially covers the basics of preference modelling, the use of preference in reasoning and argumentation, the problem of compact representations of preferences, preference learning and the use of non conventional preference models based on extended logical languages. It aims at providing a general reference for all researchers both in Artificial Intelligence and Decision Analysis interested in this exciting interdisciplinary topic.},

abstract = {Localizing the origin of a music piece around the world enables some interesting possibilities for geospatial music retrieval, for instance, location-aware music retrieval or recommendation for travelers or exploring non-Western music – a task neglected for a long time in music information retrieval (MIR). While previous approaches for the task of determining the origin of music either focused solely on exploiting the audio content or web resources, we propose a method that fuses features from both sources in a way that outperforms standalone approaches. To this end, we propose the use of block-level features inferred from the audio signal to model music content. We show that these features outperform timbral and chromatic features previously used for the task. On the other hand, we investigate a variety of strategies to construct web-based predictors from web pages related to music pieces. We assess different parameters for this kind of predictors (e.g., number of web pages considered) and define a confidence threshold for prediction. Fusing the proposed audio-and web-based methods by a weighted Borda rank aggregation technique, we show on a previously used dataset of music from 33 countries around the world that the median placing error can be reduced from 1,815 to 0 kilometers using K-nearest neighbor regression.},

As one of the most important context features,user emotion has great potential to improve recommendations,but this has not yet been sufficiently explored due to the difficulty of emotion acquisition and incorporation. This paper proposes a graph-based emotion-aware music recommendation approach (GEMRec) by simultaneously taking a user's music listening history and emotion into consideration. The proposed approach models the relations between user,music,and emotion as a three-element tuple (user,music,emotion),upon which an Emotion Aware Graph (EAG) is built,and then a relevance propagation algorithm based on random walk is devised to rank the relevance of music items for recommendation. Evaluation experiments are conducted based on a real dataset collected from a Chinese microblog service in comparison to baselines. The results show that the emotional context from a user's microblogs contributes to improving the performance of music recommendation in terms of hitrate,precision,recall,and F1 score.},

It often fails to expose non-expert users to the music that the users are not familiar with. In this paper, we suggest an emotion-aware music recommendation system that proposes songs and artists based on the mood of each user. First, we infer user's emotion using real-time weather information. Second, we classify songs and artists which are favorable in different weather conditions. To do so, we collect and combine daily chart of K-pop music and weather history data to find the music preference in different weather. It is used to recommend timely and favorable music to users after capturing their mood implcitly. Moreover the emotion-aware music recommendation system is extensible to provide a personalized service by using user's social media, heartbeat, time, location, and so on. We expect this would enrich user experience noticeably. Being aware of user's emotion will enable broad areas of industry to provide intelligent services in a user-friendly way.},

Rating prediction in CARS has been tackled by researchers attempting to recommend appropriate items to users. However, in rating prediction, three thriving challenges are still to tackle: (i) the weight of each context dimension; (ii) the correlation between context dimensions; and (iii) situation inference. A major shortcoming of the classical methods is that there is no defined way to study dependencies and interactions existing among context dimensions. Context-aware algorithms made a strong assumption that context dimensions weights are the same or initialized with random values. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach for weighting context dimensions, studying the correlation between them to infer the current situation then predict the rating based on the inferred situation. Through detailed experimental evaluation we demonstrate that the proposed approach is helpful to improve the prediction accuracy.},

In consequence, the past decade witnessed a growing interest in modeling emotions from musical signals in the music information retrieval (MIR) community. In this article, we present a novel generative approach to music emotion modeling, with a specific focus on the valence-arousal (VA) dimension model of emotion. The presented generative model, called \emph{acoustic emotion Gaussians} (AEG), better accounts for the subjectivity of emotion perception by the use of probability distributions. Specifically, it learns from the emotion annotations of multiple subjects a Gaussian mixture model in the VA space with prior constraints on the corresponding acoustic features of the training music pieces. Such a computational framework is technically sound, capable of learning in an online fashion, and thus applicable to a variety of applications, including user-independent (general) and user-dependent (personalized) emotion recognition and emotion-based music retrieval. We report evaluations of the aforementioned applications of AEG on a larger-scale emotion-annotated corpora, AMG1608, to demonstrate the effectiveness of AEG and to showcase how evaluations are conducted for research on emotion-based MIR.

abstract = {In the area of electronic commerce, recommender systems have become more and more popular. The quality of recommendations depends on the quality of the preference model extracted by the recommender system. Recently, latent factor models based on probabilistic matrix factorisation have gained great attention in both industry and academia, owing to their superior accuracy over traditional recommender systems. Although latent factor models are very efficient, the latency of the features captured in these models impedes explaining the learnt model to the users. A lack of understanding of the latent features makes it difficult to decide on the optimal number of features to give as input to these models. Therefore, the model accuracy degrades when less relevant features are introduced into the model. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose an extension to the basic matrix factorisation, so that the model takes into account the relevancy of the features beside their values. We test the accuracy of the proposed method on two benchmark datasets. The experiments show that the proposed method makes remarkable improvements over the basic method and some of the state of the art latent factor models.},

We compare the proposed emotion-based matching approach with a personalized approach where the music track is matched to themusic preferences of the user, and to a knowledge-based approach which matches music to places based on metadata (e.g., matching music that was composed during the same period that the place of interestwasbuilt in).We showthatwhenevaluating the goodnessoffit between places and music, personalization is not sufficient and that the users perceive the emotion- based music suggestions as better fitting the places.

Given the enormous rise in mobile music consumption and the many sensors integrated into today's smart-phones, at the same time, an unprecedented source for user context data of different kinds is becoming available. Equipped with a smart-phone application, which had been developed to monitor contextual aspects of users when listening to music, we collected contextual data of listening events for 48 users. About 100 different user features, in addition to music meta-data have been recorded. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between aspects of the user context and music listening preference. The goals are to assess (i) whether user context factors allow predicting the song, artist, mood, or genre of a listened track, and (ii) which contextual aspects are most promising for an accurate prediction. To this end, we investigate various classifiers to learn relations between user context aspects and music meta-data. We show that the user context allows to predict artist and genre to some extent, but can hardly be used for song or mood prediction.

abstract = {The emergence of pervasive computing, the rapid advancements in broadband and mobile networks and the incredible appeals of smart devices are driving unprecedented universal access and delivery of online-based media resources. As more and more media services continue to flood the Web, mobile users will continue to waste invaluable time, seeking content of their interest. To deliver relevant media items offering richer experiences to mobile users, media services must be equipped with contextual knowledge of the consumption environment as well as contextual preferences of the users. This article investigates context-aware recommendation techniques for implicit delivery of contextually relevant online media items. The proposed recommendation services work with a contextual user profile and a context recognition framework, using case base reasoning as a methodology to determine user's current contextual preferences, relying on a context recognition service, which identifies user's dynamic contextual situation from device's built-in sensors. To evaluate the proposed solution, we developed a case-study context-aware application that provides personalized recommendations adapted to user's current context, namely the activity he/she performs and consumption environment constraints. Experimental evaluations, via the case study application, real-world user data, and online-based movie metadata, demonstrate that context-aware recommendation techniques can provide better efficacy than the traditional approaches. Additionally, evaluations of the underlying context recognition process show that its power consumption is within an acceptable range. The recommendations provided by the case study application were assessed as effective via a user study, which demonstrates that users are pleased with the contextual media recommendations.},

The acceptance of the systems, however, depends on how users experience them in real contexts. While many of the ubicomp research projects include some form of user study, there is no overview of how user experience (UX) is approached in ubicomp research. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of ubicomp UX studies. Our findings reveal that users‘experiences with ubicomp systems have often been investigated in rather lightweight ways, for example by addressing basic usability issues, collecting ratings by simple, predetermined scales, or producing descriptions of general experiences such as fun and trust. Based on the findings we argue that a deeper and more fine-grained understanding of user experience would help developing more successful ubicomp systems. We propose a ubicomp UX framework that can help design and evaluate ubicomp systems with a desirable set of target experiences.},

abstract = {In the last decade, the spread of broadband Internet connections even for mobile devices has contributed to an increased availability of multimedia information on the Web. At the same time, due to the decrease of storage cost and the increasing popularity of storage services in the cloud, the problem of information overload has become extremely serious even in personal/company archives. The need to manage, retrieve, and present all these data has promoted the development of advanced multimedia information systems, which include recommendation modules to account for the requests of personalized data selection and presentation. Recommendation systems estimate ratings, or utilities, which quantify users' degree of interest for the different available data, so that the data can be offered to the users in a personalized way, in decreasing order of interest. Multiple approaches have been proposed in the literature to estimate such degrees of interest. In content-based filtering, the utility (for a user) of a given item is estimated as a function of the ratings given by the same user to other similar items. A dual approach is collaborative filtering, in which filtering (i.e., estimating the object's utilities) for a given user is computed by referring to the opinions of other similar users. Thus, a major challenge faced by collaborative filtering is the need to associate each user to a set of other users having similar profiles. In this chapter, we first present the co-clustering-based recommendation techniques, which allow to combine heterogeneous multimedia content information and data about the users' preferences and rankings, thus overcoming some of the content-based filtering drawbacks, as well as some collaborative filtering weaknesses. Then, we briefly discuss the challenges in multimedia delivery and the most common strategies adopted in the context of cultural heritage media delivery.},

However, these tend to act as recommendation services, introducing a user to new music they might wish to listen to. Far less effort has gone into researching tools which learn an individual user's tastes across their existing library of music and attempt to produce playlists fitting to their current mood. This paper describes a system that uses reinforcement learning over hierarchically-clustered sets of songs to learn a user's listening preferences. Features extracted from the audio are also used as part of this process, allowing the software to create cohesive lists of tracks on demand or to simply play continuously from a given starting track. This new system is shown to perform well in a small user study, greatly reducing the relative number of songs that a user skips.},

However, the performance of existing content-based methods is dissatisfactory, because those methods simply divided the listened songs into like or unlike set, and ignored user's preference degree. In this paper, an enhanced content-based music recommending method was proposed by quantifying the user preference degree to songs with weighted tags. Firstly, each listened song was classified into like or unlike set according to user's playing behaviors, such as skipping and repeating. Secondly, the songs' social tags were collected from LastFm website and weighted according to their frequency in the collected tags.Finally, the user's preference degree for each song was quantified with the weighted tags, and the candidate songs with high preference degrees would be recommended to him. On the LastFm dataset, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms those traditional content-based methods in both rating and ranking prediction.},

Thus it is more advisable to integrate measures from different aspects to estimate the underlying user/item relation. Furthermore, the estimation of underlying user/item relation should be optimal for current task. To this end, we propose a novel model to couple multiple relations measured on different aspects, and determine the optimal user/item relations via learning the optimal way of integrating these relation measures. Specifically, matrix factorization model is extended in this paper by considering the relations between latent factors of different users/items.

None of the approaches in the literature is able to automatically group the users in order to overcome the previously presented limitation. This paper presents a set of group recommender systems that automatically detect groups of users by clustering them, in order to respect a constraint on the maximum number of recommendation lists that can be produced.

Since context-awareness has become almost a necessity in mobile applications, web applications need to adapt to this new reality. A universal development approach for context-aware applications is inherently complex due to the requirement to manage diverse context information from different sources and at different levels of granularity. A context middleware can be a key enabler in adaptive applications, since it can serve in hiding the complexity of context management functions, promoting reusability and enabling modularity and extensibility in developing context-aware applications. In this paper we present our work on a cross-platform framework that fulfils the above. We elaborate on the need for cross-platform support in context-aware web application development for mobile computing environments identifying gaps in the current state of context support. The paper introduces the architecture of the middleware that fills these gaps and provides examples of its main components.

Whatever scenario, there is plenty of space to improve accuracy since big data is a problem when scale increases. Semantic search is an alternative to improve search accuracy by understanding the contextual meaning of terms as they appear in the searchable data space. Among the several approaches to Semantic Search methodologies, a variation of Ontology-based search (or Logic Approach) is the one adopted. In this methodology, the engine not only understands hierarchical relationships of entities, however also more complex inter-entities relationships defined inside ontologies.

A portal prototype is designed and implemented for the domain of online dealership's vehicle buyer's market. Precision and Recall measures are the two major indices of information retrieval. They have been used to evaluate the prototype results. After calculating these two metrics over some searches, we have seen that Precision is 86.66% and Recall is 68.42%.

Inspired by a cognitive architecture named ACT-R, this paper combines frequency and recency into contextual information to provide context-based recommendations for mobile applications. The experimental results show the ACT-R inspired method is effective in context-based recommendations.},

@article{campos2013timeaware,
abstract = {Exploiting temporal context has been proved to be an effective approach to improve recommendation performance, as shown, e.g. in the Netflix Prize competition. Time-aware recommender systems (TARS) are indeed receiving increasing attention. A wide range of approaches dealing with the time dimension in user modeling and recommendation strategies have been proposed. In the literature, however, reported results and conclusions about how to incorporate and exploit time information within the recommendation processes seem to be contradictory in some cases. Aiming to clarify and address existing discrepancies, in this paper we present a comprehensive survey and analysis of the state of the art on TARS. The analysis show that meaningful divergences appear in the evaluation protocols used - metrics and methodologies. We identify a number of key conditions on offline evaluation of TARS, and based on these conditions, we provide a comprehensive classification of evaluation protocols for TARS. Moreover, we propose a methodological description framework aimed to make the evaluation process fair and reproducible. We also present an empirical study on the impact of different evaluation protocols on measuring relative performances of well-known TARS. The results obtained show that different uses of the above evaluation conditions yield to remarkably distinct performance and relative ranking values of the recommendation approaches. They reveal the need of clearly stating the evaluation conditions used to ensure comparability and reproducibility of reported results. From our analysis and experiments, we finally conclude with methodological issues a robust evaluation of TARS should take into consideration. Furthermore we provide a number of general guidelines to select proper conditions for evaluating particular TARS. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The framework can easily be extended to detect custom activities and is built in a generic way to ensure easy integration with other applications. On top of this framework, a recommender system is built to provide users a personalized content offer, consisting of relevant information such as points-of-interest, train schedules, and touristic info, based on the user's current context. An evaluation of the recommender system and the underlying context recognition framework shows that power consumption and data traffic is still within an acceptable range. Users who tested the recommender system via the mobile application confirmed the usability and liked to use it.

In recent years, research on contextual music recommendation has emerged and new services have been introduced. Driving is one of the most common listening situations. It differs from other listening situations in that the main focus is on driving, which means the mental load is higher. The scenario of listening to music while driving has been neglected in past research and is therefore reflected by the limited integration of textual music adaptation in car radios or infotainment systems. This paper presents the results of a preliminary study involving a driving simulator created to analyze the effects of various types of music on subjects while driving. As the results of the subjective measure show, there is a strong influence on the mental load of participants listening to fast-paced music while driving. According to these findings, a first prototype of an application was implemented allowing the driver to adjust the music selection with respect to the mental load as well as personal preference. This application uses contextual parameters and performs as a research prototype for future real-driving studies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

The context is considered at multiple levels: first in selecting the interesting rules following to the current session of visits of the user; then into a relevance measure containing a geographic measure that considers her current geographic position. Besides the ge-ographic measure, the relevance measure combines a social measure and an in-terest measure. The social measure takes into account the habits of the user's friends and the interest measure depends on the current intention of the user among predefined intention scenarios. An important aspect of this work is that we propose a framework allowing the personalization of the recommendations by acting only on the relevance measure.

abstract = {This position paper provides an overview of current research endeavors and existing solutions in multimodal music retrieval, where the term "multimodal" relates to two aspects. The first one is taking into account the music context of a piece of music or an artist, while the second aspect tackled is that of the user context. The music context is introduced as all information important to the music, albeit not directly extractable from the audio signal (such as editorial or collaboratively assembled meta-data, lyrics in textual form, cultural background of an artists, or images of album covers). The user context, in contrast, is defined by various external factors that influence how a listener perceives music. It is therefore strongly related to user modeling and personalization, both facets of music information research that have not gained large attention by the MIR community so far. However, we are confident that adding personalization aspects to existing music retrieval systems (such as playlist generators, recommender systems, or visual browsers) is key to the future of MIR. In this vein, this contribution aims at defining the foundation for future research directions and applications related to multimodal music information systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs) aim at helping users search large amounts of contents and identify more effectively the items (products or services) that are likely to be more useful or attractive. The quality of a RS can be defined from two perspectives: system-centric, in which quality measures (e.g., precision, recall) are evaluated using vast datasets of preferences and opinions on items previously collected from users that are not interacting with the RS under study; user-centric, in which user measures are collected from users interacting with the RS under study. Prior research in e-commerce has provided some empirical evidence that system-centric and user-centric quality methods may lead to inconsistent results, e.g., RSs that were "best" according to system-centric measures were not the top ones according to user-centric measures. The paper investigates if a similar mismatch also exists in the domain of e-tourism. We discuss two studies that have adopted a system-centric approach using data from 210000 users, and a user-centric approach involving 240 users interacting with an online hotel booking service. In both studies, we considered four RSs that employ an implicit user preference elicitation technique and different baseline and state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. In these four experimental conditions, we compared system-centric quality measures against user-centric evaluation results. System-centric quality measures were consistent with user-centric measures, in contrast with past studies in e-commerce. This pinpoints that the relationship between the two kinds of metrics may depend on the business sector, is more complex that we may expect, and is a challenging issues that deserves further research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{xing2013tensor,
abstract = {Audio resources are a very important part of multimedia information. The classification effect of audio is directly related to the service mode of personal resource management systems. At present, vector features have been widely used in audio classification systems. However, some semantic correlations among different audio information can not be completely expressed by simple vector representation. Tensors are multidimensional matrices, and their mathematical expansion and application can express multi-semantic information. The tensor uniform content locator (TUCL) is proposed as a means of expressing the semantic information of audio, and a three-order tensor semantic space is constructed according to the semantic tensor. Tensor semantic dispersion (TSD) can aggregate some audio resources with the same semantics and, at the same time, its automatic classification can be accomplished by calculating the TSD. In order to effectively utilize TSD classification information, a radial basis function tensor neural network (RBFTNN) is constructed and used to train an intelligent learning model. Experimental results show that the tensor model can significantly improve the classification precision under multi-semantic classification requests within an information resource management system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The increasing amount of online music content has opened opportunities for implementing new effective information access services—commonly known as music recommender systems—that support music navigation, discovery, sharing, and formation of user communities. In recent years, a new research area of contextual music recommendation and retrieval has emerged. Context-aware music recommender systems are capable of suggesting music items taking into consideration contextual conditions, such as the user's mood or location, that may influence the user's preferences at a particular moment. In this work, we consider a particular kind of context-aware recommendation task—selecting music content that fits a place of interest (POI). To address this problem we have used emotional tags assigned to both music tracks and POIs, and we have considered a set of similarity metrics for tagged resources to establish a match between music tracks and POIs. Following an initial web-based evaluation of the core matching technique, we have developed a mobile application that suggests an itinerary and plays recommended music for each visited POI, and evaluated it in a live user study. The results of the study show that users judge the recommended music as suited for the POIs, and that the music is rated higher when it is played in this usage scenario.},

abstract = {With the advent of the ubiquitous era, many studies have been devoted to various situation-aware services in the semantic web environment. One of the most challenging studies involves implementing a situation-aware personalized music recommendation service which considers the user's situation and preferences. Situation-aware music recommendation requires multidisciplinary efforts including low-level feature extraction and analysis, music mood classification and human emotion prediction. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for a situation-aware/user-adaptive music recommendation service in the semantic web environment. To do this, we first discuss utilizing knowledge for analyzing and retrieving music contents semantically, and a user adaptive music recommendation scheme based on semantic web technologies that facilitates the development of domain knowledge and a rule set. Based on this discussion, we describe our Context-based Music Recommendation (COMUS) ontology for modeling the user's musical preferences and contexts, and supporting reasoning about the user's desired emotions and preferences. Basically, COMUS defines an upper music ontology that captures concepts on the general properties of music such as titles, artists and genres. In addition, it provides functionality for adding domain-specific ontologies, such as music features, moods and situations, in a hierarchical manner, for extensibility. Using this context ontology, we believe that logical reasoning rules can be inferred based on high-level (implicit) knowledge such as situations from low-level (explicit) knowledge. As an innovation, our ontology can express detailed and complicated relations among music clips, moods and situations, which enables users to find appropriate music. We present some of the experiments we performed as a casestudy for music recommendation. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

abstract = {With rapid growth in the online music market, music recommendation has become an active research area. In most current approaches, content-based recommendation methods play an important role. Estimation of similarity between music content is the key to these approaches. A distance formula is used to calculate the music distance measure, and music recommendations are provided based on this measure. However, people have their own unique tastes in music. This paper proposes a method to calculate a personalized distance measure between different pieces of music based on user preferences. These methods utilize a randomized algorithm, a genetic algorithm, and genetic programming. The first two methods are based on Euclidean distance calculation, where the weight of each music feature in the distance calculation approximates user perception. The third method is not limited to Euclidean distance calculation. It generates a more complex distance function to estimate a user's music preferences. Experiments were conducted to compare the distance functions calculated by the three methods, and to compare and evaluate their performance in music recommendation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

@article{castellano2012a,
abstract = {Today, handheld devices can accommodate a large amount of different resources. Thus, a considerable effort is often required to mobile users in order to search for the resources suitable for the specific circumstance. Further, this effort rarely brings to a satisfactory result. To ease this work, resource recommenders have been proposed in the last years. Typically, the recommendation is based on recognizing the current situations of the users and suggesting them the appropriate resources for those situations. The recognition task is performed by exploiting contextual information and preferably without using any explicit input from the user. To this aim, we propose to adopt a collaborative scheme based on an emergent paradigm. The underlying idea is that simple individual actions can lead to an emergent collective behavior that represents an implicit form of contextual information. We show how this behavior can be extracted by using a multi-agent scheme, where agents do not directly communicate amongst themselves, but rather through the environment. The multi-agent scheme is structured into three levels of information processing. The first level is based on a stigmergic paradigm, in which marking agents leave marks in the environment in correspondence to the position of the user. The accumulation of such marks enables the second level, a fuzzy information granulation process, in which relevant events can emerge and are captured by means of event agents. Finally, in the third level, a fuzzy inference process, managed by situation agents, deduces the user situations from the underlying events. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a set of representative real scenarios related to meeting events. In all the scenarios, the collaborative situation-aware scheme promptly recognizes the correct situations, except for one case, thus proving its effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In order to adapt functionality to their individual users, systems need information about these users. The Social Web provides opportunities to gather user data from outside the system itself. Aggregated user data may be useful to address cold-start problems as well as sparse user profiles, but this depends on the nature of individual user profiles distributed on the Social Web. For example, does it make sense to re-use Flickr profiles to recommend bookmarks in Delicious? In this article, we study distributed form-based and tag-based user profiles, based on a large dataset aggregated from the Social Web. We analyze the completeness, consistency and replication of form-based profiles, which users explicitly create by filling out forms at Social Web systems such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. We also investigate tag-based profiles, which result from social tagging activities in systems such as Flickr, Delicious and StumbleUpon: to what extent do tag-based profiles overlap between different systems, what are the benefits of aggregating tag-based profiles. Based on these insights, we developed and evaluated the performance of several cross-system user modeling strategies in the context of recommender systems. The evaluation results show that the proposed methods solve the cold-start problem and improve recommendation quality significantly, even beyond the cold-start. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

This article incorporates collaborative filtering (CF), the most successful and widely used filtering technique, in social networks to facilitate users in exploring new friends having similar interests while being connected with old ones as well. Here, first we design an implicit rating model, for estimating a user's affinity toward his friends, which uncover the strength of relationship, utilizing both attribute similarity and user interaction intensity. We then propose a CF-based framework that offers list of friends to the user by leveraging on the preference of like-minded users, with a given small set of people that user has already labeled as friends. Despite the immense success of CF, accuracy and sparsity are still major challenges, especially in social networking domain with a staggering growth having enormous number of users. To address these inherent challenges, first we have explored the idea of adaptive similarity computation between users by employing evolutionary algorithms to learn individual preferences toward particular set of attributes that results in considerable improvement in recommendation accuracy as compared to the situation where all the attributes are given equal importance. Second, we incorporate effective missing data prediction algorithm as a solution to data sparsity thereby further enhancing accuracy. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed friends recommendation schemes.},

Thayer's plane which says human emotions is determined by the psychological arousal and valence. We map music pieces onto the arousal-valence plane, and classify the music emotion in that space. We extract 85 acoustic features from music signals, rank those by the information gain and choose the top k best features in the feature selection process. In order to map music pieces in the feature space onto the arousal-valence space, we apply genetic programming. The genetic programming is designed for finding an optimal formula which maps given music pieces to the arousal-valence space so that music emotions are effectively classified. k-NN and SVM methods which are widely used in classification are used for the classification of music emotions in the arousal-valence space. For verifying our method, we compare with other six existing methods on the same music data set. With this experiment, we confirm the proposed method is superior to others. {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems and The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Personalization and context-awareness are highly important topics in research on Intelligent Information Systems. In the fields of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and Music Recommendation in particular, user-centric algorithms should ideally provide music that perfectly fits each individual listener in each imaginable situation and for each of her information or entertainment needs. Even though preliminary steps towards such systems have recently been presented at the "International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference" (ISMIR) and at similar venues, this vision is still far away from becoming a reality. In this article, we investigate and discuss literature on the topic of user-centric music retrieval and reflect on why the breakthrough in this field has not been achieved yet. Given the different expertises of the authors, we shed light on why this topic is a particularly challenging one, taking computer science and psychology points of view. Whereas the computer science aspect centers on the problems of user modeling, machine learning, and evaluation, the psychological discussion is mainly concerned with proper experimental design and interpretation of the results of an experiment. We further present our ideas on aspects crucial to consider when elaborating user-aware music retrieval systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Analysis and description of digital audio, being one of the fundamental information sources in the modern world, becomes surprisingly complex when it comes to music information retrieval. In addition to the numerous known classic problems, such as pitch and rhythm extraction, tempo analysis, audio key detection or chord estimation, there exist further considerable difficulties in higher-level analysis involving e.g. emotional content or genre categorization. These issues are of utmost interest for the rapidly growing music industry and new e-commerce solutions which necessitate the need for precise estimation of users' musical preferences. Out of the many proposed approaches, those based on modelling the social context and behavior of a user via collaborative filtering techniques, although potentially effective, do not offer real insight into the decision-making process. The content-based methods, on the other hand, enable to build refined models of users' preferences with adjustable weights attributed to different musical elements and varied description levels. This chapter presents an evaluation of the latest efforts and development in fields related to music information retrieval, as well as a study of melody based approaches for use with recommendation systems. The evaluation concentrates on algorithms extracting audio features relevant to the idea of similarity analysis and recommendation proposals. Only content-based audio analysis approaches are taken into account. Tasks such as audio key detection, chord estimation, tempo analysis or genre classification are described, latest achievements and algorithms are presented and ways in which they can be effectively used in recommendation systems are estimated. The concept of audio melody extraction is explored and the authors' own research results in this subject are presented. Possible usage scenarios of melody analysis for music recommendation services are evaluated. Application in conjunction with query by humming and query by tapping systems is analysed as an example of a complete recommender solution. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.},

This work is based on the idea that information extracted from social networks, such as Facebook and Last.fm, might be effectively exploited for personalization tasks. Indeed, information related to music preferences of users can be easily gathered from social platforms and used to define a model of user interests. The use of social media is a very cheap and effective way to overcome the classical cold start problem of recommender systems. In this work we enriched social media-based playlists with new artists related to those the user already likes. Specifically, we compare two different enrichment techniques: the first leverages the knowledge stored on DBpedia, the structured version of Wikipedia, while the second is based on the content-based similarity between descriptions of artists. The final playlist is ranked and finally presented to the user that can listen to the songs and express her feedbacks. A prototype version of MyMusic was made available online in order to carry out a preliminary user study to evaluate the best enrichment strategy. The preliminary results encouraged keeping on this research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Despite the benefits, there is no known automated method for formulating and tailoring an optimized interval training protocol for a specific individual that maximizes the amount of calories burned while limiting fatigue. Additionally, an application that provides the aforementioned optimal training protocol must also provide motivation for repetitious and tedious exercises necessary to improve a patient's adherence. This paper presents a system that efficiently formulates an optimized interval training method for each individual by using data mining schemes on attributes, conditions, and data gathered from individuals exercise sessions. This system uses accelerometers embedded within iPhones, a Bluetooth pulse oximeter, and the Weka data mining tool to formulate optimized interval training protocols and has been shown to increase the amount of calories burned by 29.54% as compared to the modified Tabata interval training protocol. We also developed a behavioral cueing system that uses music and performance feedback to provide motivation during interval training exercise sessions. By measuring a user's performance through sensor readings, we are able to play songs that match the user's workout plan. A hybrid collaborative, content, and context-aware filtering algorithm incorporates the user's music preferences and the exercise speed to enhance performance. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

abstract = {In order to generate relevant recommendations, a context-aware recommender system (CARS) not only makes use of user preferences, but also exploits information about the specific contextual situation in which the recommended item will be consumed. For instance, when recommending a holiday destination, a CARS could take into account whether the trip will happen in summer or winter. It is unclear, however, which contextual factors are important and to which degree they influence user ratings. A large amount of data and complex context-aware predictive models must be exploited to understand these relationships. In this paper, we take a new approach for assessing and modeling the relationship between contextual factors and item ratings. Rather than using the traditional approach to data collection, where recommendations are rated with respect to real situations as participants go about their lives as normal, we simulate contextual situations to more easily capture data regarding how the context influences user ratings. To this end, we have designed a methodology whereby users are asked to judge whether a contextual factor (e.g., season) influences the rating given a certain contextual condition (e.g., season is summer). Based on the analyses of these data, we built a contextaware mobile recommender system that utilizes the contextual factors shown to be important. In a subsequent user evaluation, this system was preferred to a similar variant that did not exploit contextual information. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London Limited 2011.},

Specifically, our system is a middleware that realizes the recommendation process based on a combination of music genre classification and personality diagnosis. A mobile user is able to query for music files by simply sending an example music file from his/her mobile device. In response to the user query, the system recommends music files that not only belong to the same genre as the user query, but also an attempt has been made to take into account both the user preferences as well as ratings from other users for candidate results. The recommendation mechanism is realized by applying the collaborative filtering technique of personality diagnosis. Using the minimum absolute error and the ranked scoring criteria, our approach is compared to existing recommendation techniques that rely on either collaborative filtering or content-based approaches. The outcome of the comparison clearly indicates that our approach exhibits significantly higher performance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {An important task in network modeling is the prediction of relationships between classes of objects, such as friendship between persons, preferences of users for items, or the influence of genes on diseases. Factorizing approaches have proven effective in the modeling of these types of relations. If only a single binary relation is of interest, matrix factorization is typically applied. For ternary relations, tensor factorization has become popular. A typical application of tensor factorization concerns the temporal development of the relationships between objects. There are applications, where models with n-ary relations with n > 3 need to be considered, which is the topic of this paper. These models permit the inclusion of context information that is relevant for relation prediction. Unfortunately, the straightforward application of higher-order tensor models becomes problematic, due to the sparsity of the data and due to the complexity of the computations. In this paper, we discuss two different approaches that both simplify the higher-order tensors using coupled low-order factorization models. While the first approach, the context-aware recommendation tensor decomposition (CARTD), proposes an efficient optimization criterion and decomposition method, the second approach, the context-aware regularized singular value decomposition (CRSVD), introduces a generative probabilistic model and aims at reducing the dimensionality using independence assumptions in graphical models. In this article, we discuss both approaches and compare their ability to model contextual information. We test both models on a social network setting, where the task is to predict preferences based on existing preference patterns, based on the last item selected and based on attributes describing items and users. The experiments are performed using data from the GetGlue social network and the approach is evaluated on the ranking quality of predicted relations. The results indicate that the CARTD is superior in predicting overall rankings for relations, whereas the CRSVD is superior when one is only interested in predicting the top-ranked relations.},

abstract = {Albeit the implicit feedback based recommendation problem-when only the user history is available but there are no ratings-is the most typical setting in real-world applications, it is much less researched than the explicit feedback case. State-of-the-art algorithms that are efficient on the explicit case cannot be straightforwardly transformed to the implicit case if scalability should be maintained. There are few implicit feedback benchmark datasets, therefore new ideas are usually experimented on explicit benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a generic context-aware implicit feedback recommender algorithm, coined iTALS. iTALS applies a fast, ALS-based tensor factorization learning method that scales linearly with the number of non-zero elements in the tensor. The method also allows us to incorporate various contextual information into the model while maintaining its computational efficiency. We present two context-aware implementation variants of iTALS. The first incorporates seasonality and enables to distinguish user behavior in different time intervals. The other views the user history as sequential information and has the ability to recognize usage pattern typical to certain group of items, e.g. to automatically tell apart product types that are typically purchased repetitively or once. Experiments performed on five implicit datasets (LastFM 1K, Grocery, VoD, and "implicitized" Netflix and MovieLens 10M) show that by integrating context-aware information with our factorization framework into the state-of-the-art implicit recommender algorithm the recommendation quality improves significantly. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

So, for instance, music recommendations while the user is traveling by car should take into account the current traffic condition or the driver's mood. This requires the acquisition of ratings for items in several alternative contextual situations, to extract from this data the true dependency of the ratings on the contextual situation. In this paper, in order to simplify the in-context rating acquisition process, we consider the individual perceptions of the users about the influence of context on their decisions. We have elaborated a system design methodology where we assume that users can be requested to judge: a) if a contextual factor (e.g., the traffic state) is relevant for their decision making task, and b) how they would rate an item assuming that a certain contextual condition (e.g., traffic is chaotic) holds. Using these evaluations we show that it is possible to build an effective context-aware mobile recommender system. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

In order to test our hypothesis, i.e., that the users will reckon that a music track suits a POI when this track is selected by our approach, we have designed a live user experiment where subjects are repeatedly presented with POIs and a selection of music tracks, some of them matching the presented POI and some not.

abstract = {Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) has become a practical platform for pervasive services. Various user data could be requested for accessing such a service. However, it is normally difficult for a user to justify whether it is safe and proper to disclose personal data to others in different contexts. For solving this problem, we propose AdPriRec, a context-aware recommender system for preserving user privacy in MANET services. To support frequent changes of node pseudonyms in MANET, we develop a hybrid recommendation generation solution. We apply a trusted recommendation sever who knows the node's real identity to calculate a recommendation vector based on long term historical experiences. The vector can be also generated at each MANET node according to recent experiences accumulated based on node pseudonyms, while this vector could be further fine-tuned when the recommendation server is accessible. We design a number of algorithms for AdPriRec to generate context-aware recommendations for MANET users. The recommendation vector is calculated based on a number of factors such as data sharing behaviors and behavior correlation, service popularity and context, personal data type, community information of nodes and trust value of each involved party. An example based evaluation illustrates the usage and implication of the factors and shows AdPriRec's effectiveness. A prototype implementation based on Nokia N900 further proves the concept of AdPriRec design. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The number of cancer patients who live more than 5 years after surgery exceeds 53.9% over the period of 1974 and 1990; Treatments for cancer patients are important during the recovery period, as physical pain and cancer fatigue affect cancer patients' psychological and social functions. Researchers have shown that interval training improves the physical performance in terms of fatigue level, cardiovascular build-up, and hemoglobin concentration, the feelings of control, independence, self-esteem, and social relationship during cancer rehabilitation and chemotherapy periods. The lack of proper individual motivation levels and the difficulty in following given interval training protocols results in patients stopping interval training sessions before reaching proper exhaustion levels. In this work, we use behavioral cueing using music and performance feedback, combined with a social network interface, to provide motivation during interval training exercise sessions. We have developed an application program on the popular lightweight iPhone platform, embedded with several leveraged sensors. By measuring the exercise accuracy of the user through sensor readings, specifically accelerometers embedded in the iPhone, we are able to play suitable songs to match the user's workout plan. A hybrid of a content-based, context-aware, and collaborative filtering methods using Bayesian networks incorporates the user's music preferences and the exercise speed that will enhance performance. Additionally, exercise information such as the amount of calorie burned, exercise time, and the exercise accuracy, etc. are sent to the user's social network group by analyzing contents of the web database and contact lists in the user's iPhone. {\textcopyright} Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2010.},

abstract = {Nowadays, recommender systems are widely used in various domains to help customers access to more satisfying products or services. It is expected that exploiting customers' contextual information can improve the quality of recommendation results. Most earlier researchers assume that they already have customers' explicit ratings on items and each rating has customer's abstracted context (e.g. summer, morning). However, in practical applications, it is not easy to obtain customers' explicit ratings and their abstract-level contexts. We aim to acquire customers' preferences and their context by exploiting the information implied in the customers' previous event logs and to adopt them into a well known recommendation technique, Collaborative Filtering (CF). In this paper, we show how to obtain customers' implicit preferences from event logs and present a strategy to abstract context information from event logs considering fuzziness in context. In addition, we present several methods to cooperate achieved contextual information and preferences into CF. To evaluate and compare our methods, we conducted several empirical experiments using a set of music listening logs obtained from last.fm, and the results indicate that our methods can improve the quality of recommendation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{han2009music,
abstract = {Context-based music recommendation is one of rapidly emerging applications in the advent of ubiquitous era and requires multidisciplinary efforts including low level feature extraction and music classification, human emotion description and prediction, ontology-based representation and recommendation, and the establishment of connections among them. In this paper, we contributed in three distinctive ways to take into account the idea of context awareness in the music recommendation field. Firstly, we propose a novel emotion state transition model (ESTM) to model human emotional states and their transitions by music. ESTM acts like a bridge between user situation information along with his/her emotion and low-level music features. With ESTM, we can recommend the most appropriate music to the user for transiting to the desired emotional state. Secondly, we present context-based music recommendation (COMUS) ontology for modeling user's musical preferences and context, and for supporting reasoning about the user's desired emotion and preferences. The COMUS is music-dedicated ontology in OWL constructed by incorporating domain-specific classes for music recommendation into the Music Ontology, which includes situation, mood, and musical features. Thirdly, for mapping low-level features to ESTM, we collected various high-dimensional music feature data and applied nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for their dimension reduction. We also used support vector machine (SVM) as emotional state transition classifier. We constructed a prototype music recommendation system based on these features and carried out various experiments to measure its performance. We report some of the experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

@incollection{jensen2010effective,
abstract = {An increasing number of applications include recommender systems that have to perform search in a non-metric similarity space, thus creating an increasing demand for efficient yet flexible indexing techniques to facilitate similarity search. This demand is further fueled by the growing volume of data available to recommender systems. This paper addresses the demand in the specific domain of music recommendation. The paper presents the Music On Demand framework where music retrieval is performed in a continuous, stream-based fashion. Similarity measures between songs, which are computed on high-dimensional feature spaces, often do not obey the triangular inequality, meaning that existing indexing techniques for high-dimensional data are infeasible. The most prominent contribution of the paper is the proposal of an indexing approach that is effective for non-metric similarities. This is achieved by using a number of bitmap indexes combined with effective bitmap compression techniques. Experiments show that the approach scales well. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

@incollection{lampropoulos2010a,
abstract = {In this paper, we address the recommendation process as a one-class classification problem based on content features and a Negative Selection (NS) algorithm that captures user preferences. Specifically, we develop an Artificial Immune System (AIS) based on a Negative Selection Algorithm that forms the core of a music recommendation system. The NS-based learning algorithm allows our system to build a classifier of all music pieces in a database and make personalized recommendations to users. This is achieved quite efficiently through the intrinsic property of NS algorithms to discriminate "self-objects" (i.e. music pieces of user's like) from "non self-objects", especially when the class of non self-objects is vast when compared to the class of self-objects and the examples (samples) of music pieces come only from the class of self-objects (music pieces of user's like). Our recommender has been fully implemented and evaluated and found to outperform state of the art recommender systems based on support vector machines methodologies. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},
