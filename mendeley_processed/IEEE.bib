abstract = {Traditional recommendation methods suffer from limited performance, which can be addressed by incorporating abundant auxiliary/side information. This article focuses on a personalized music recommender system that incorporates rich content and context data in a unified and adaptive way to address the abovementioned problems. The content information includes music textual content, such as metadata, tags, and lyrics, and the context data incorporate users' behaviors, including music listening records, music playing sequences, and sessions. Specifically, a heterogeneous information network (HIN) is first presented to incorporate different kinds of content and context data. Then, a novel method called content- and context-aware music embedding (CAME) is proposed to obtain the low-dimension dense real-valued feature representations (embeddings) of music pieces from HIN. Especially, one music piece generally highlights different aspects when interacting with various neighbors, and it should have different representations separately. CAME seamlessly combines deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms, with the embedding model to capture the intrinsic features of music pieces as well as their dynamic relevance and interactions adaptively. Finally, we further infer users' general musical preferences as well as their contextual preferences for music and propose a content- and context-aware music recommendation method. Comprehensive experiments as well as quantitative and qualitative evaluations have been performed on real-world music data sets, and the results show that the proposed recommendation approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is able to handle sparse data effectively.},

abstract = {Mood and emotion play an important role when it comes to choosing musical tracks to listen to. In the field of music information retrieval and recommendation, emotion is considered contextual information that is hard to capture, albeit highly influential. In this study, we analyze the connection between users' emotional states and their musical choices. Particularly, we perform a large-scale study based on two data sets containing 560,000 and 90,000 #nowplaying tweets, respectively. We extract affective contextual information from hashtags contained in these tweets by applying an unsupervised sentiment dictionary approach. Subsequently, we utilize a state-of-The-Art network embedding method to learn latent feature representations of users, tracks and hashtags. Based on both the affective information and the latent features, a set of eight ranking methods is proposed. We find that relying on a ranking approach that incorporates the latent representations of users and tracks allows for capturing a user's general musical preferences well (regardless of used hashtags or affective information). However, for capturing context-specific preferences (a more complex and personal ranking task), we find that ranking strategies that rely on affective information and that leverage hashtags as context information outperform the other ranking strategies.},

abstract = {The number of 'hits' has been widely regarded as the lifeblood of many web systems, e.g., e-commerce systems, advertising systems and multimedia consumption systems. However, users would not hit an item if they cannot see it, or they are not interested in the item. Recommender system plays a critical role of discovering interesting items from near-infinite inventory and exhibiting them to potential users. Yet, two issues are crippling the recommender systems. One is 'how to handle new users', and the other is 'how to surprise users'. The former is well-known as cold-start recommendation. In this paper, we show that the latter can be investigated as long-tail recommendation. We also exploit the benefits of jointly challenging both cold-start and long-tail recommendation, and propose a novel approach which can simultaneously handle both of them in a unified objective. For the cold-start problem, we learn from side information, e.g., user attributes, user social relationships, etc. Then, we transfer the learned knowledge to new users. For the long-tail recommendation, we decompose the overall interesting items into two parts: A low-rank part for short-head items and a sparse part for long-tail items. The two parts are independently revealed in the training stage, and transfered into the final recommendation for new users. Furthermore, we effectively formulate the two problems into a unified objective and present an iterative optimization algorithm. A fast extension of the method is proposed to reduce the complexity, and extensive theoretical analysis are provided to proof the bounds of our approach. At last, experiments of social recommendation on various real-world datasets, e.g., images, blogs, videos and musics, verify the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art work.},

abstract = {One-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) problems are prevalent in real-world recommender systems, such as news and music recommendation, but suffer from sparsity issues and particularly lack negatively preferred items. To address the challenge, the state-of-the-art algorithms assigned uninteracted items smaller weights of being negative and performed low-rank approximation over a user-item interaction matrix. However, the prior ratings of uninteracted items are usually set to zero but may not well-defined. To avert the prior ratings of uninteracted items, in this paper, we propose a novel ranking-based implicit regularizer by hypothesizing that users preference scores for uninteracted items are close to each other. The regularizer is then used in a ranking-based OCCF framework to penalize large difference of preference scores between uninteracted items. To optimize model parameters in this framework, we develop a scalable alternating least square algorithm and coordinate descent algorithm, whose time complexity is linearly proportional to data size. Finally, we extensively evaluate the proposed algorithms with six real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed regularizer significantly improves recommendation quality of ranking-based OCCF algorithms, such as BPRMF and RankALS. Moreover, the ranking-based framework with the proposed regularizer outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms for implicit feedback.},

In the aging society, the elder people generally call for specialized healthcare services that are often provisioned by their residential areas or houses or communities. In this situation, recommending appropriate houses or real estates to the elder people becomes a necessity to help create a healthy elderly care service community, which contribute much to the stability and health of the whole nation even all the world. However, the personalized preferences of the elder people are often hard to capture and profile as the requirements from the elder people are generally vague and undetermined. Moreover, the profiles of the elder people stored in different cloud platforms are often sensitive enough, which block the rational and full use of the valuable elder people profiles for better elder people preference prediction. Considering the above two challenging issues, in this research work, we propose a privacy-aware real estate recommendation method for elderly care based on the historical consumption behaviors of the elder people stored in cloud platforms. At last, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposal are validated by a series of experiments based on a real-world dataset.

abstract = {Provable Data Possession (PDP) model provides an efficient means for people to audit the integrity of data stored in cloud storage. When sensitive data is shared among multiple users based on cloud storage, it is critical to preserve the anonymity of the data uploader against the auditor. That is, the auditor should not get data uploader's identity through the data audition. To address this problem, many PDP schemes with user identity privacy-persevering are proposed. However, most proposed schemes are designed based on PKI technique which suffers from big burden of certificate management. Moreover, data auditors in most proposed schemes bear heavy computation cost which results to the lower efficiency of the scheme. To overcome the shortcomings, we present a novel identity-based PDP protocol to audit efficiently the integrity of group shared data with uploader's privacy-preserving. Due to the inherent structural advantage of identity-based crypto mechanism, our PDP scheme is able to avoid the problem of certificate management. Different from previous works, our scheme ensures the relationship of the data and the data uploader in the phase of proof generation not the phase of integrity audition. Therefore, the data auditor does not know the relationship at all as well as the extract data uploader of the challenged data. At the same time, establishing the relationship by cloud server in proof generation step can reduce the computational cost of data auditor greatly. Furthermore, the relationship of data uploader and challenged data in the proof is randomized so as to strength the security of the scheme. All these efforts are made in our scheme to efficiently realize the anonymity protection of the data uploader. We give the detailed security proof of our scheme under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. Many experiments are performed to evaluate the efficiency of our scheme, the results show that our new scheme is efficient and feasible.},

abstract = {Traditional recommendation algorithms based on collaborative filtering suffer from a data sparsity problem. The emergence of online social network has enriched the user's information, realizing a new way to solve recommendation tasks. Social-aware recommendation algorithms can effectively alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the performance of recommendation systems. Despite the success of these algorithms, they have some common limitations. Most algorithms assume that social networks are homogeneous, with similar preferences among connected users. However, users may only share similar preferences in some aspects. Besides, different friends affect the user's preference in different levels. And this influence of friends on users' preference should be adaptive. Even close friends may have different influences in different decision-making processes. For example, a user may trust a friend in 'travel' but distrust this friend in 'music' because this friend had more travel experiences. Motivated by the above limitations, we designed a neural network model called adaptive attention neural network for social recommendation (ANSR) to study the interaction between a user and his or her social friends as well as infer the complex influence of the user's social relationships on the user's preferences. By utilizing the co-attention mechanism, we can not only extract the user's special attention to certain aspects of their friends but also determine the adaptive influences of different friends on the user. When the user interacts with different items, different attention weights will be assigned to the user and his or her friends, respectively. In addition, we also utilize network embedding to learn more efficient features of each user and incorporate these features into the ANSR to enhance the recommendation results. Moreover, we also conduct extensive experiments on four different real-world datasets and demonstrate that our proposed method performs better on all datasets compared with the state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

abstract = {Self-Attention mechanism is primarily designed to capture the correlation (interaction) between any two objects in a sequence. Inspired by self-Attention's success in many NLP tasks, some researchers have employed self-Attention in sequential recommendation to refine user representations by capturing the correlations between the historical interacted items of a user. However, the user representations in previous self-Attention based models are not flexible enough since the self-Attention is only applied on user side, restricting performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a deep recommendation model with feature-level self-Attention, namely SAFrec, which exhibits enhanced recommendation performance mainly due to its two advantages. The first one is that SAFrec employs self-Attention mechanism on user side and item side simultaneously, to co-refine user representations and item representations. The second one is that, SAFrec leverages item features distilled from open knowledge graphs or websites, to represent users and items on fine-grained level (feature-level). Thus the correlations between users and items are discovered sufficiently. The extensive experiments conducted over two real datasets (NetEase music and Book-Crossing) not only demonstrate SAFrec's superiority on top-n recommendation over the state-of-The-Art deep recommendation models, but also validate the significance of incorporating self-Attention mechanism and feature-level representations.},

In this paper, we investigate the relationships among time, location and organizer in EBSNs, and propose a Spatial-Temporal Topic Model (STTM) for cold-start event recommendation. STTM can capture user's interests on content and geographical space changing over time, and users have different event and venue topic distributions at different times in STTM. We perform an experimental evaluation on the real-world EBSNs dataset. The experimental results show the significant improvements of our method over other comparison methods, especially when dataset is more sparse.},

abstract = {Music recommendation methods predict users' music preference primarily based on historical ratings. Meanwhile, manifold personal factors of users are also important for the problem, and research efforts have been made to improve the recommendation performance with auxiliary user information. As an important indicator of users' personal traits and states, the numerous social media content (e.g., texts, images and short videos), however, is still hardly exploited. In this work, we systematically study the utilization of multimodal social media content for music recommendation. We define groups of both targeted handcrafted features and generic deep features for each modality, and further propose an Attentive Multimodal Autoencoder approach (AMAE) to learn cross-modal latent representations from the extracted features. Attention mechanism is also employed to integrate users' global and contextual music preference with alterable weights. Experiments demonstrate remarkable improvement of recommendation performance (+2.40% in Hit Ratio and +3.30% in NDCG), manifesting the effectiveness of our AMAE approach, as well as the significance of incorporating social media content data in music recommendation.},

abstract = {The emotional use of music plays an important role in influencing people's music-searching behaviour. Many users listen to music for multiple mood regulation purposes. Therefore, emotional preference should be taken into consideration especially when building context-aware music recommendation systems which aim to satisfy users' short-term music needs. In addition, cultural differences will affect the way people experience and value emotion from music. Based on these aspects, we investigate the emotional preference of music in daily activities through a cross-cultural survey in China and the UK, and build emotional maps between activity and music for the two countries. Furthermore, we introduce EmoMusic, a novel emotion-based music recommendation service for daily activities which supports visualisation and control of music emotion through an interactive interface. A user study is presented to evaluate the application. Results reveal good usability of the service and show that visualization and interaction in a music emotion space can improve acceptance of music recommendations. Our work helps to understand the emotional preference of music for various activities and how to exploit emotional cues of music in a music recommendation service, paving the way for more user-centered music recommendation systems.},

The method is based on the technique of distributed representation of words. Instead of the metadata, such as genres and artists, the proposed approach takes the listening environment into consideration. By using the listening environment, it is possible to recommend music lyrics that fit the atmosphere of a touristspot when the user enjoys the sightseeing. In this paper, the proposed method recommends the lyrics that fits the atmosphere of a tourist-spot by sharing the distributed representation beyond the domains of lyrics and reviews. The method uses a corpus of lyrics to build the distributed representation model, and both lyrics' and reviews' vectors are calculated with the model. As a result, the tourist-spot reviews are assumed to be types of lyrics. Based on the lyric-like vector representation of reviews, the similarity between reviews and lyrics can be calculated. The experiment showed a positive result to the recommendation made by the proposed method.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art music recommendation systems are based on collaborative filtering, which predicts a user's interest from his listening habits and similarities with other users' profiles. These approaches are agnostic to the song content, and therefore face the cold-start problem: they cannot recommend novel songs without listening history. To tackle this issue, content-aware recommendation incorporates information about the songs that can be used for recommending new items. Most methods falling in this category exploit either user-annotated tags, acoustic features or deeply-learned features. Consequently, these content features do not have a clear musical meaning, thus they are not necessarily relevant from a musical preference perspective. In this work, we propose instead to leverage a model of musical preference which originates from the field of music psychology. From low-level acoustic features we extract three factors (arousal, valence and depth), which have been shown appropriate for describing musical taste. Then we integrate those into a collaborative filtering framework for content-aware music recommendation. Experiments conducted on large-scale data show that this approach is able to address the cold-start problem, while using a compact and meaningful set of musical features.},

abstract = {Recommender systems recommend new movies, music, restaurants, etc. Typically, service providers organize such systems in a centralized way, holding all the data. Biases in the recommender systems are not transparent to the user and lock-in effects might make it inconvenient for the user to switch providers. In this paper, we present the concept, design, and implementation of MobRec, a mobile platform that decentralizes the data collection, data storage, and recommendation process. MobRec's architecture does not need any backend and solely consists of the users' smartphones, which already contain the users' preferences and ratings. Being in proximity in public places or public transportation, data is exchanged in a device-to-device manner, building local databases that can recommend new items. One of biggest challenges of such a system is the implementation of unobtrusive device-to-device data exchange on off-the-shelf Android devices and iPhones. MobRec facilitates such data exchange, building on Google Nearby Messages with Bluetooth Low Energy. We achieve the successful exchange of data within 3 to 4 minutes, making it suitable for the described scenario. We demonstrate the feasibility of decentralized recommender systems and provide blueprints for the development of seamless multi-platform device-to-device communication.},

@article{wen2020physician,
abstract = {In recent years, web-based appointment platforms develop rapidly, and many of them provide physician recommendation services to patients. Considering patients' heterogeneity in both illness and behavior, it is a great challenge to deliver personalized recommendations. Motivated by this healthcare application, this study incorporates patient choices and focuses on optimizing real-time personalized recommendation of physician assortment with limited resources, in order to satisfy patients' varying demands and improve the resource allocation efficiency. This work considers not only the influence of physician assortment to patient choice but also how physicians in the assortment are displayed on the webpage, i.e., the order of physicians. We adopt the location-based two-stage choice model to capture the patient behavior, in which patients randomly view the top physicians and then choose one among them. The recommendation problem is studied in both static and dynamic environments. In the static environment, we ignore resource capacities and optimize the recommendation of physician assortment as well as the displayed ranking. We propose a heuristic algorithm SORT for this static version of the problem and prove the lower bound of algorithm performance, along with the numerical performance validation. In the dynamic environment, we optimize the physician recommendations for a sequence of randomly arriving patients considering patients' heterogeneity in both matching degrees and choice probabilities. We propose a dynamic algorithm Adjust-exponential inventory balancing (Adjust-EIB) by incorporating our static algorithm SORT in the improved existing algorithm, which makes recommendation decisions based on the real-time remaining resources. We conduct a series of numerical experiments to compare our algorithm with several benchmarks. The numerical results show that Adjust-EIB outperforms the benchmark algorithms, especially in congested systems. We also conduct a case study with real-world data and verify the capability of our algorithm in improving real-world system efficiency. Note to Practitioners - This work is motivated by the increasing popularity of web-based appointment platforms. Considering the fact of limited physician resources, we address the issue of how to recommend physicians for patients in a personalized and real-time way on web-based appointment platform, in order to improve the matching degree between physicians and patients as well as the resource allocation efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, we propose one of the initial methods to recommend personalized physician rankings in dynamic environments with limited resources. We construct a specific model and propose algorithms to make physician recommendation decision, which performs better than other benchmark approaches based on the numerical analysis, and the case study with real-world system data indicates our method's capability of solving the practical problem. Our method is robust enough for the reason that the model allows arbitrary arrival pattern. The model and methods are specifically designed for the web-based appointment platforms, but it can also be easily applied in other application scenarios based on visual web pages, such as e-commerce.},

On the other hand, in dealing with the sparsity problem, community context information that is extracted from the social network containing all users is used for predicting unprovided ratings. As predicted ratings are not a hundred percent accurate, while the provided ratings are actually evaluated by users, we also develop a new method for calculating user-user similarities, in which provided ratings are considered to be more significant than predicted ones.

Traditional music recommendations commonly collect users' feedbacks in limited ways for preference analysis. The text dialogue is a direct and natural interactive mode, providing diversified information. In this paper, we discuss the music recommendation in an innovative scenario - a conversational music recommendation model, which integrates the advantages both from the recommender system and dialog system. This paper adopts a 'user ask, system respond' interactive way to obtain users' real-time requirements, and users are allowed to express their requirements on music in free text. In order to face the fast-changing music preferences, this paper adopts the bandit-based algorithm to absorb users' attitudes to the current recommendation, and the results show these methods achieve better performance than baselines. Besides, it also constructs a music-domain knowledge graph to support the richer users' musical expressions with millions of music items and tens of millions of relations.},

abstract = {Relationships in online social networks often imply social connections in real life. An accurate understanding of relationship types benefits many applications, e.g. social advertising and recommendation. Some recent attempts have been proposed to classify user relationships into predefined types with the help of pre-labeled relationships or abundant interaction features on relationships. Unfortunately, both relationship feature data and label data are very sparse in real social platforms like WeChat, rendering existing methods inapplicable.In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of WeChat relationships to identify the major challenges for the relationship classification task. To tackle the challenges, we propose a Local Community-based Edge Classification (LoCEC) framework that classifies user relationships in a social network into real-world social connection types. LoCEC enforces a three-phase processing, namely local community detection, community classification and relationship classification, to address the sparsity issue of relationship features and relationship labels. Moreover, LoCEC is designed to handle large-scale networks by allowing parallel and distributed processing. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world WeChat network with hundreds of billions of edges to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of LoCEC.},

Some aggregation-based and model-based group recommendation methods have been proposed. However, the cold-start problem in group recommendation has not been well studied, which limits the application of group recommendation in many important domains, such as recommending offline events for a group of users. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid deep framework to solve cold-start problem of group event recommendation. Our framework incorporates multiple Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and conditional RBM. The former extracts high latent group preference from user feedback and group feedback. The latter obtains latent event features based on contextual information, such as location and organizer of events. Thus, the hybrid deep framework can utilize user feedback and contextual information of events to overcome cold-start problem. We conduct exhaustive experiments on two real-world datasets and the results show that our proposed framework outperforms the baseline group recommendation methods and alleviates the cold-start problem of group event recommendation effectively.},

abstract = {There are more than 2,000 Karaoke stores in Japan and approximately 50 million users visit every year for a singing experience. For Karaoke, recommendations of the next songs play a significant role in leading customers to explore more songs and make the most of time in Karaoke. However, few recommendation functions are provided due to the difficulty and uniqueness of the Karaoke environment, in which unknown groups choose songs based on with whom they are sharing the Karaoke experience and the group mood; solid information of these factors is not available. In this paper, we propose a session-based multivariate recurrent neural network (RNN) to consider an occasion for a Karaoke store visit and any possible mood changes; these factors are assumed to be embedded in the sequential data. The model uses metadata from previously played songs, the conditions present, and performs several tasks that predict the songs and artists to be played at time t to t+n. It outperformed the item-kNN algorithm for prediction tasks (offline) of the next song by 127.94% regarding MAP@20 and the next artist by 142.8% regarding MAP@10. In addition, we analyzed the performance of the model for three types of groups, namely individuals, older groups, and younger groups that were manually categorized from played songs, and it outperformed the item-kNN algorithm by 89.59%, 483.11%, and 50.88% regarding MAP@20 respectively. The model also outperformed the baselines for all positions in a session, which demonstrates that it has the potential to quickly capture the preferences of a target group and to recognize mood changes from the sequence. We have launched a recommender system that is designed for Japanese Karaoke stores. The system has demonstrated that the model used in this system is also appliable to business applications due to its ability to handle vast numbers of requests in a reasonable time and enhance user experience by helping to choose more diverse songs faster.},

This leaves us an opportunity to generate better recommendation results by considering the impacts of all offered choices. However, such an extension cannot be handled efficiently by traditional top- k list recommendation methods, due to the entire list dependency issue which means a complete list of items is needed before we can precisely measure any item preference among the list. In this paper, we propose a Co-displayed Items Aware (CDIA) list generation approach, which is based on the reinforcement learning architecture, and can efficiently generate high-utility lists. Specifically, we propose CDIA-Sim to predict users' preferences, which considers the impacts of the co-displayed items. Then, to overcome the entire list dependency issue in the list recommendation task, we utilize the reinforcement learning technique and design CDIA-RL to generate high-utility lists. Experimental results show that CDIA-Sim achieves significant improvements in modeling user-item preferences, and CDIA-RL can yield lists efficiently and effectively, illustrating better performance than other competitors.},

Recently, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based models are widely used in sequential recommendation tasks with great success. Previous works mainly focus on the interaction sequences of the current session without analyzing a user's long-term preferences. In this paper, we propose a joint neural network (JNN) for session-aware recommendation, which employs a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and a RNN to process the long-term historical interactions and the short-term sequential interactions respectively. Then, we apply a fully-connected neural network to study the complex relationship between these two types of features, which aims to generate a unified representation of the current session. Finally, a recommendation score for given items is generated by a bi-linear scheme upon the session representation. We conduct our experiments on three public datasets, showing that JNN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on all datasets in terms of Recall and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The outperforming results indicate that proper handling of historical interactions can improve the effectiveness of recommendation. The experimental results show that JNN is more prominent in samples with short current session or long historical interactions.},

Knowledge graph, as a sort of auxiliary and structural data, is full of semantic and logical connections among entities in the world. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Knowledge and Interest Propagation Network(HKIPN) for recommendation, where a new heterogeneous propagation method is presented. Specifically, HKIPN propagates knowledge and user interest simultaneously in a unified graph combined by user-item bipartite interaction graph and knowledge graph. During the propagation, a hierarchical method is devised to aggregate a node's high-order neighbors explicitly and concurrently. Besides, an attention mechanism is employed to discriminate the importance of neighbors. Furthermore, due to information decay in the process of propagation, the decay factor, as the weight of each hierarchical representation to compose the final user-and-item representations, is taken into account. We apply the proposed model to three benchmark datasets about movie, book, and music recommendation and compare it with state-of-the-art baselines. The experiment results and further studies demonstrate that our approach outperforms compelling recommender baselines.},

The traditional collaborative filtering algorithm is not satisfactory in the recommendation of tourist attractions. This paper builds a tourist attraction tag system, which links tourists and tourist attractions through the attractions tag from four aspects: location, location type, travel time, and travel method. By calculating the relationship between tourists and attractions tags, tourist attractions and attractions tags, a user interest model is constructed. Then, according to the user interest model, the interest degree of the new attraction to be recommended is predicted, and finally the tourist attraction recommendation set is generated.},

The types of information are diversified and abundant in recommendation systems; therefore the proportion of unstructured multimodal data such as text, image, and video is increasing. However, due to the representation gap between different modalities, it is intractable to effectively use unstructured multimodal data to improve the efficiency of recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multimodal interest-related item similarity model (multimodal IRIS) to provide recommendations based on the multimodal data source. Specifically, the multimodal IRIS model consists of three modules, i.e., multimodal feature learning module, the interest-related network (IRN) module, and item similarity recommendation module. The multimodal feature learning module adds knowledge sharing unit among different modalities. Then, IRN learns the interest relevance between target item and different historical items respectively. Finally, the multimodal feature learning, IRN, and item similarity recommendation modules are unified into an integrated system to achieve performance enhancements and to accommodate the addition or absence of different modal data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, by dealing with the multimodal data which people may pay more attention to when selecting items, the proposed multimodal IRIS significantly improves accuracy and interpretability on top-N recommendation task over the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {There are numerous contexts where individuals typically consume a few items from a large selection of possible items. Examples include purchasing products, listening to music, visiting locations in physical or virtual environments, and so on. There has been significant prior work in such contexts on developing predictive modeling techniques for recommending new items to individuals, often using techniques such as matrix factorization. There are many situations, however, where making predictions for both previously-consumed and new items for an individual is important, rather than just recommending new items. We investigate this problem and find that widely-used matrix factorization methods are limited in their ability to capture important details in historical behavior, resulting in relatively low predictive accuracy for these types of problems. As an alternative we propose an interpretable and scalable mixture model framework that balances individual preferences in terms of exploration and exploitation. We evaluate our model in terms of accuracy in user consumption predictions using several real-world datasets, including location data, social media data, and music listening data. Experimental results show that the mixture model approach is systematically more accurate and more efficient for these problems compared to a variety of state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods.},

This work proposes a model for random object generation that introduces two key novel elements: (i) a similarity metric based on the distance between objects in a given object sequence, that is also used to measure similarity between meta-data associated with the objects, such as artists and genres; (ii) a hierarchical graph model with different graphs each associated with a different meta-data. A biased random walk in each graph that are coupled and synchronized dictate the random generation of objects, leveraging the current context to constrain randomness. The proposed model is fully parameterized from sequences of objects, requiring no external parameters or tuning. The model is applied to a large music dataset with over 1 million playlists generating a hierarchy with three layers (genre, artist, track).

However, existing methods largely assume that KGs are complete when transferring knowledge from them, which may lead to suboptimal performance for those KGs, can be hardly complete in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we present a robustly co-learning model (RCoLM) that takes the incompleteness nature of KGs into consideration when incorporating them into recommendation. The RCoLM aims at transferring knowledge between recommendation task and knowledge graph completion (KG completion) task by utilizing a transfer learning model. An earlier version of this paper appeared in KDD 2019. This version is an extension of the previous submission and two major innovations are presented here. At first, distinct from previous knowledge-aware recommendation methods, which mainly focus on transferring knowledge from KGs to item recommendations, the RCoLM attempts to exploit user-item interactions from recommendations for KG completion, and unifies the two tasks in a joint model for mutual enhancements. Second, the RCoLM provides a general task-oriented negative sampling strategy on KG completion task, which further improves the adaptive ability of the proposed algorithm and plays an essential role for obtaining superior performance in various sub-tasks of the KG completion. The extensive experiments on two real-world public datasets demonstrate that RCoLM outperforms not only state-of-the-art knowledge-aware recommendation methods but also existing KG completion methods.},

abstract = {A novel method for music video recommendation is presented in this paper. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. (i) The proposed method constructs a network, which not only represents relationships between music videos and users but also captures multi-modal features of music videos. This enables collaborative use of multi-modal features such as audio, visual, and textual features, and multiple social metadata that can represent relationships between music videos and users on video hosting services. (ii) A novel scheme for link prediction considering local and global structures of the network (LP-LGSN) is newly derived by fusing multiple link prediction scores based on both local and global structures. By using the LP-LGSN to predict the degrees to which users desire music videos, the proposed method can recommend users' desired music videos. The experimental results for a real-world dataset constructed from YouTube-8M show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Segregating the songs and playing them in accordance to one's mood could facilitate the music lover. Although there exist a lot of algorithms designed for it, the computation is not as expected. This paper eradicates such an issue by using CNN. In order to obtain minimal processing, multilayer perceptron are implemented by CNNs. In comparison to various algorithms for image classification, CNNs observed to have little-processing. This implies that the filters used in CNNs are advantageous when compared to traditional algorithm. The visualization of features directly can be less informative. Hence, we use the training procedure of back-propagation to activate the filters for better visualization. The multiple actions such as capturing, detecting the emotion and classifying the same can all be confined as one step through the use of CNN. The slow performances of the real-time approaches could be enhanced by regularizing the methods and by visualizing the hidden features. Hence the proposed approach could enhance the accuracy and the computation speed.},

One of the methods to improve user's cost satisfaction in recommending multimedia contents is to use mood inherent in multimedia contents. SNS services based on mood folksonomy are applications using such a method. However, in the applications based on folksonomy, the problem caused by synonyms exists. This paper suggests a cost-satisfactive multimedia contents recommendation method to solve the problem on synonym. To this end, we utilizes the value of Arousal Valence which express mood of multimedia content as its internal tag. A method that defines the relation between AV values of multimedia contents and AV values of mood tags is suggested by considering synonym and the correlation between them is analyzed. From the analysis, it is shown that the AV values of multimedia contents with a mood tag and its synonyms reside in the area of the mood tag in the Thayor model.},

In reality, taxi drivers may have their preferred destination regions to avoid traffic jams or to execute arranged pickup orders. However, no prior work managed to maximize the profit of drivers and satisfy the requirements for destination regions at the same time. To tackle this challenge, we propose a PROfit Maximization recommendatIon SystEm (PROMISE) based on the inter-regional probability. In this paper, we first divide the city map into sub-regions and compute the mobility probability of passengers among pick-up points and sub-regions, namely inter-regional mobile probability. Then, we propose an efficient Driving Route Suggestion (DRS) algorithm based on inter-regional probability, which can maximize the profit of taxi drivers with designated destination regions. The experimental results based on the taxi traces collected from Shanghai, China, validate the effectiveness of the proposed recommender system.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of internet-accessing smart devices and fast growth of music streaming platforms has greatly changed the way people consume and share music. Thus, music recommender systems got in the focus of research in academia as well as industry. However, the standardization of the number of users listening to music has been directly used in decomposition of collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, which ignores the user listening to recorded tracks of the actual distribution and leads to failure to fully exploit this information for making the personalization recommendation. In addition, while music content analysis has been an active research topic for decades, the technologies are still in their infancy. The melody, rhythm, timbre and other important characteristics of the music is difficult to extract and process, as a result, the content features of music itself is not fully considered in most of the personalized music recommendation system for users, causing they are not satisfied for the music recommendation. In order to solve the above problems, our method RTCF (Tag-driven Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System), by analyzing the historical records of tracks of users in the data sets, we set up a reasonable scoring mechanism for users based on the training statistical language model (Good-Turing Estimate). In addition, we found that the tag has a related count when describing a song or an artist, which means that different tags can describe the characteristics of the track and the artist in varying degree. In combination with our analysis of the listening records of each user, the tags not only serve as additional information to broaden the content of the music but build the personalized music recommendation for users. According to the experimental results of users on the dataset containing tags, it indicates that our proposal method has a great advantage over other tag-based methods in making personalized recommended performance.},

abstract = {Huge video data that available at many video hosting providers create a new problem. One of them is a problem in video discovery system. One of many solutions that solve the problem is video search function. But, video search function cannot provide best user experience despite using a good keyword. This problem encourages many video hosting service providers to get deeper insight of the video data that they have and used them to give the best experience to the user. A video service provider such as Youtube will perform video analysis based on the internal video contents such as colours, textures, shapes, music signal, video title provided by users and other features that exist in video. The result of this analysis was used to understand its video content and also user preference on a video. At the last, an insight about user personalities can be known and video provider can personalize video for each user to give them best user experience. With technological developments in Machine Learning and Computer Vision technology, video analysis can be done based on other things beyond the video. It was the audience's impression of a video. An analysis of audience impressions in real-time was expected to get insights of a video content by a real feeling of the viewers. By those insights, a new video recommendation system can be built to deliver a new experience for the user in video discovery system. This system is intended to be able to deliver variative videos which match their personal emotion at the time. Based on this research results, 65% users love more than half in video list that provided by impression-based recommender system.},

In this paper, we mainly propose a smart alarm sound recommendation system and construct an application to study how alarm sounds can impact human emotions. The recommendation system is deployed on the cloud, working with smartphones to deliver smart alarm sounds by considering not only sleep patterns, but also context information such as weather. The designed system can recommend smart alarm sounds to users, orchestrate sensing data collected by multiple sensors on smartphones, and collaborate with cloud computing to recommend preferable alarm sounds. An application is developed to demonstrate system effectiveness, which consists of the fore-end on Android OS and the back-end on the cloud. Experiments demonstrate that our system can recommend smart alarm sounds to wake participants up in the morning and the participants give feedback about their emotional states. The results show the system can improve people's emotion states by about 14.57%, compared to traditional alarm sound delivery.},

As more users are joining these online consumer and entertainment sectors, the profile-based data for providing accurate just-in-time recommendations is rising thanks to strategies based on collaborative filtering or content-based metrics. However, these systems merely focus on providing the right item for the users without taking into account what would be the best strategy to suggest the movie, the product or the song (i.e. the strategy to increase the success or impact of the recommendation). Taking this research gap into consideration, this paper proposes a profile-based recommendation system that outputs a set of potential persuasive strategies that can be used with users with similar characteristics. The scope of the tailored persuasive strategies is to make office-based employees of tertiary buildings increase their pro-environmental awareness and enhance the energy efficiency at work (the dataset used on this research is specific of this sector).

However, the key challenges in these systems are extracting dynamic context information and updating user's profile information. Recently by the popularity of IoT devices as well as the availability of the wireless network, a massive volume of data is available to gain useful insights into user profile which contains dynamic contextual information. IoT sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data, we need to understand them and use them in a context-aware computing platform. In this article, an adaptive context-aware service composition system is proposed using an IoT based social network dataset to find users' preferences, improve quality of experience, and boosts the personalization level of services. This paper proposes an 10T-based context-aware service composition to seamlessly find adaptive services offered by a service provider at anytime and anywhere. Firstly, the proposed system considers the dynamic social profile of the user and clusters their preferences while other systems take only static user interests into account. Secondly, this system increases the level of personalization by extracting context information from a user's IoT devices. Finally, the adaptive service composition provides users with various context-aware recommendation including movies, music, venues, radio stations, and events simultaneously. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed system, we target some of the smart objects such as smart watches/bands, smartphones/tablets, Google Home, and personal computers for detecting several contexts (e.g location, time, user activity, interest and e.t.c.). Experimental evaluations show that the proposed algorithm can improve accuracy and personalization of filtered items with compare to other widely-applied conventional filtering algorithms.},

abstract = {Music listening is a very personal and situational behavior for modern people who always carry smartphones in everyday life. Therefore, contextual information, such as user's current activity and mood state could be used to greatly improve music recommendations. In this paper, we develop a smartphone-based mobile system that includes two core modules for recognizing human activities and then accordingly recommending music. In the proposed method, a deep residual bidirectional gated recurrent neural network is applied to obtain high activity recognition accuracy from accelerometer signals on the smartphone. In order to improve the performance of tempo-oriented music classification, an ensemble of dynamic classification using a long-term modulation spectrum and sequence classification using a short-term spectrogram is used. Music recommendation is performed using the relationship between the recognized human activities and the music files indexed by tempo-oriented music classification that reflects user preference models in order to achieve high user satisfaction. The results of comprehensive experiments on real data confirm the accuracy of the proposed activity-aware music recommendation framework.},

abstract = {Listening to and singing music online have become two popular forms of entertainment for people. Online music service providers are devoted to recommend personalized music to users, so that more users can be attracted by spending more money on their music service platform. Hence, an accurate recommendation for users is one of the most important tasks for the music service companies. This paper proposes a novel recommender system for recommending music. According to the preliminary measurement, we find that the interest of users on music changes over time. Furthermore, we notice that the time interval between two consecutive listened/sung musics can reflect the temporal interests of users. Based on these findings, we propose MusicRecLSTM, which leverages the attention mechanism and a modified LSTM network to learn the embeddings of both the user and the music based on the sequential data and the temporal context. MusicRecLSTM also learns whether a user would tend to listen to a newly released music at a specific time. Evaluations over three real-world datasets show that the proposed MusicRecLSTM can provide high precision, compared to several state-of-the-art recommender systems, with at least 20% improvement on the recall and mean reciprocal metrics.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose new methods for generating playlists with a single graph, which represents multiple types of relations in a playlist. Although current users are familiar with online music services, they have difficulty in deciding which tracks to listen to because there are millions of tracks available on such services. Automated playlist generation is one of the best solutions to solving this costly task of finding interesting tracks from the enormous tracks. Accordingly, one playlist-generation task, namely, hit rate, in which several tracks are given as a user query, is focused on in this study. There are four types of context objects (playlists, tracks, artists, and users) in the basic information on playlists, and three types of relations (playlists contain tracks and artists, users create playlists and artists play and/or sing tracks) in playlists. First, different types of relations in playlists are combined, and a single graph linking different context objects is generated. Next, a random walk is applied to the graph, and the expected values of track nodes are calculated on the basis of the transition probabilities of nodes in the graph. Finally, tracks are recommended in order of the expected values. The results of an experimental evaluation of the proposed methods in comparison with conventional methods revealed that one of the proposed methods (RW-hybrid) improved effectiveness by up to 21%. Moreover, this method reduces execution time as much as the fastest existing methods.},

Bipartite network, as a special complex network, reflects the characteristics of a kind of network in our life truly and objectively. Therefore, detecting community structure in bipartite networks is of great significance and has practical value. In this paper, we first introduce two concepts: a) a micro-bipartite network model Bi-EgoNet which can be used to analyze bipartite network from a micro view to reduce the complexity of structure in bipartite networks, and b) a complete bipartite graph that is a special bipartite graph with the indivisible property. Then, we propose a novel overlapping community detection algorithm based on a complete bipartite graph in micro-bipartite network Bi-EgoNet (CBGBEN), which combines advantages of both a complete bipartite graph and Bi-EgoNet to get an optimal community structure. The CBGBEN is evaluated on accuracy and effectiveness in several synthetic and real-world bipartite networks. The CBGBEN is compared with other excellent existing algorithms, and our experimental results demonstrated that CBGBEN is better at detecting overlapping community structure in bipartite networks.},

Most of the music recommendation systems are based on user ratings and acoustic features of the songs. Those systems are unable to address the cold start problem and rating diversity. Furthermore, song preferences will be altering based on the current mood of the users. If these problems were not addressed, then these online services will fail to achieve user satisfaction.

abstract = {Typically, recommender systems from any domain, be it movies, music, restaurants, etc., are organized in a centralized fashion. The service provider holds all the data, biases in the recommender algorithms are not transparent to the user, and the service providers often create lock-in effects making it inconvenient for the user to switch providers. In this paper, we argue that the user's smartphone already holds a lot of the data that feeds into typical recommender systems for movies, music, or POIs. With the ubiquity of the smartphone and other users in proximity in public places or public transportation, data can be exchanged directly between users in a device-to-device manner. This way, each smartphone can build its own database and calculate its own recommendations. One of the benefits of such a system is that it is not restricted to recommendations for just one user - ad-hoc group recommendations are also possible. While the infrastructure for such a platform already exists - the smartphones already in the palms of the users - there are challenges both with respect to the mobile recommender system platform as well as to its recommender algorithms. In this paper, we present a mobile architecture for the described system - consisting of data collection, data exchange, and recommender system - and highlight its challenges and opportunities.},

An improved collaborative filtering algorithm is proposed for solving the problem that the relationship between recommendation time as well as accuracy cannot be weighed and how to protect user privacy. In this paper, the matrix dimension reduction technique of locally optimized singular value decomposition(SVD) and the K-means clustering technique are used to reduce the dimensions and cluster similar users in the user-item scoring matrix. The approximate difference matrix is used to represent the local structure of the scoring matrix to implement the local optimization. The locally optimized SVD technique can alleviate the problem of data sparsity and poor scalability in collaborative filtering by using fewer iterations. K-means clustering technique can greatly narrow the search range of neighbor sets and improve the recommendation speed. Therefore, collaborative filtering algorithms based on dimensionality reduction and clustering can generate recommendations in an accurate and real-time manner. The experimental results on the MovieLens dataset show that the algorithm can reduce the impact of data sparsity, protect user privacy and effectively improve the accuracy of recommendation.},

abstract = {—Music mood is useful for music-related applications such as music retrieval or recommendation, which represents the inherent emotional expression of music signals. In this paper, a novel technique is proposed for music signal analysis in the view of emotions, which is based on the orthogonal matching pursuit, Gabor functions, and the Wigner distribution function. The technique, called the OMPGW method, consists of three-level schemes: the low-level, the middle-level and the high-level schemes. For the low-level schemes, the orthogonal matching pursuit combined with Gabor functions is proposed to provide an adaptive time-frequency decomposition of music signals. Compared with other algorithms for signal analysis, the proposed algorithm can achieve a higher spatial and temporal resolution and give a better interpret of the music signal structures. In the middle-level schemes, the Wigner distribution function is applied to obtain the time-frequency energy distribution of the results from the low-level schemes. High-level schemes are used to describe the modeling of audio features, the procedure of music mood classification. A classifier based on support vector machines is utilized to model the extracted features with the proposed technique regarding the emotion models. Several experiments are conducted with four datasets, and better results are achieved with the proposed method. In music mood classification experiments, music clips are classified into different kinds of mood clusters, and mean accuracy of 69.53 percent on our dataset can be achieved using the OMPGW method.},

abstract = {Web-based appointment systems are emerging in healthcare industry providing patients with convenient and diversiform services, among which physician recommendation is becoming more and more popular tool to make assignments of physicians to patients. Motivated by a popular physician recommendation application on a web-based appointment system in China, this paper gives a pioneer work in modeling and solving the physician recommendation problem. The application delivers personalized recommendations of physician assortments to patients with heterogeneous illness conditions, and then, patients would select one physician for appointment according to their preferences. Capturing patient preferences is essential for physician recommendation delivery; however, it is also challenging due to the lack of data on patient preferences. In this paper, we formulate the physician recommendation problem based on which the preference learning algorithm is proposed that optimizes the recommendations and learns patient preferences at the same time. Since the illness conditions of patients are heterogeneous, the algorithm aims to make personalized recommendation for each patient. Besides demonstrating the effectiveness of algorithm performance in terms of regret bound, we also provide extensive numerical experiments to show the expected algorithm performance under heterogeneous reward scenarios and performance comparison with algorithms in the literature under fixed reward scenarios. We introduce the flexibility of adjusting preference estimate update interval into our algorithm and conclude that short update interval contributes to short-term performance while long update interval leads to good results in the long run. Furthermore, we analyze how preference bound helps the algorithm to make explorations, which constitute two major contributions of our algorithm. Finally, we discuss the relevance between patient preferences and physician utilization and present a utilization-balancing approach that is effective in numerical experiments. Note to Practitioners-This paper aims at addressing the challenge of recommending physicians to patients on web-based appointment systems, so as to achieve efficient and effective utilization of physician resources. Currently, the recommendations are delivered manually by a huge number of general practitioners hired by the platforms based on their expertise and experiences. Upon each arrival of patient, they upload symptom statements of their own illness, and then, general practitioners will give a score or a rating on how well these patients are matched to physicians on the basis of symptom descriptions. With the development of artificial intelligence and information technology, these works might be done efficiently and effectively by algorithms automatically. To accomplish that, challenges will be presented: 1) physicians with adequate expertise might conflict with patient preferences, i.e., patients have strong preference toward senior specialists but their illness should be taken care of by a junior physician. This conflict indicates the importance of capturing patient preferences and choices in web-based appointment system operations and 2) the lack of patient preferences information makes the problem even harder. For newly developed web-based system, there are no available historical data to infer the preference parameters. On the other hand, the historical data in the web-based appointment system might not be able to reveal full information on patient preferences, because the system did not conduct effective and comprehensive explorations over all possible operations in the past. We capture the heterogeneous illness conditions in terms of rewards to imply the potential health improvement of patients. This paper assumes complete information of patient illness descriptions, and therefore, we focus on the operations management of appointment system, i.e., how to deliver the optimized physician assortment.},

Existing methods usually embed users with their temporal dynamics, which may have lost their long-term, intrinsic preferences. RNN is widely adopted to model users' behaviors for its expressiveness on modeling sequential information. However, RNN-based methods are insufficient to capture users' intrinsic preferences due to short-term dependency issues. In this paper, we aim to make progress from two perspectives: 1. extract users' intrinsic preferences from their historical behaviors more effectively and robustly; 2. explore a fine-tuning way to combine users' intrinsic preferences and external dynamic interests. To do so, we propose a modification of Dynamic Memory Network with gating mechanism for generating a dynamic, precise representation for individual users. We also design an automatic and implicit method, and it utilizes the intrinsic preferences as a trigger signal to search the input sequences and retrieves the temporal dynamics of users in the memory module. As a result, a desirable combination of temporal dynamics and intrinsic preferences is achieved. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have shown our model's superiority over the existing baseline method. Further analysis of the attention weights of each hop demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, researches on distributed online algorithm on multiple machines are still in its infancy, and this stage has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we investigate the triangle counting problem in large-scale simple undirected graphs whose edges arrive as a stream. We propose two distributed online streaming algorithms to estimate the global number of triangles, which are based on the current best performance sampling-based streaming algorithm. We mainly realize the reasonable partition of the graph stream, so that each worker independently estimates the number of triangles in a subgraph of the graph stream. Experimental results show that our algorithms reduce the estimation error and are several times more accurate than state-of-The-Art streaming algorithms.},

abstract = {Recommender systems help users find items they are likely to interact within the near future, such as products to buy in e-commerce or songs to play in music websites. The Traditional recommendation methods make predictions based on long-term user profiles, i.e., the items a user interacted with in the past while ignoring the time and order of the interactions. Recent findings, however, suggest that users may exhibit interest to items in a certain order depending on situations and more recent items in a sequence have a larger impact on the subsequent choices. Moreover, in many practical applications, user-item interactions are organized into short sessions, where each session reflects the user's short-term interest in addition to long-term preferences. Leveraging both long-term user profiles and short-term sequential patterns from sessions can lead to more accurate models known as the session-aware recommendation methods. In this paper, we explore various strategies to integrate user long-term preferences with session patterns encoded by recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The strategies include integrating user embeddings with input and output of session RNNs, integrating with fixed or adaptive contributions of the user and session components by using a specially designed gating mechanism. We conducted an empirical evaluation of three publicly available datasets. The results indicate that combining user long-term profiles with the output of session RNNs yields improved predictions and the proposed adaptive integration model outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential and session-aware recommendation methods.},

abstract = {The present world has an oversupply problem in regard to current products. In order to the solve oversupply problem, we are breaking down the trade barriers between countries. However, in the future, it can be an era of breaking down individual trade barriers of a person and resolving oversupply of goods. This means that it will be an important issue in analyzing the characteristics of each person and providing the goods that match them. Music is an invisible and intangible product even though we can see this as a commodity as well, meaning that the music market is also a time period of oversupply because the paradigm has changed from analog to electronic music. In other words, the time it takes to make music has been shortened radically. After the paradigm shifted to the era of electronic music, the value of music streaming market exploded. In other words, it was a concept of music ownership in the past, but now it can be said that it has turned into a concept of approaching music. The market value of approaching concepts such as streaming is exploding. In order to overcome the oversupply problem and to recommend it, it is obviously a limit to distinguish music as the current profile elements such as genres, titles, and artists. So we work on classifying on of the greatest features of music: The lyrics. Since the lyrics of music consist of texts, music can be considered to contain human emotions because humans can convey their feelings in texts. We can use sensibility of the lyrics of music to classify music. We used about 11,000 lyrics based on the Billboard Chart from Hot 100. The Natural Language Processing (NLP) work was done to refine each of the lyrics, and the music was digitized as sentiment and emotion. After selecting a new song using the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm, we propose a method for recommending music with the most similar lyrics. In conclusion, we can inform users of songs with lyrics that are most similar to the overproduction of music.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of mobile Internet applications, it is more and more difficult for mobile users to choose the right commodity in the face of a large amount of commodity information. Recommendation system is one of the effective means to solve the problem of information overload. However, the low-hardware configuration and limited computing capacity are common problems in most mobile devices, which make mobile computing applications face more and more serious challenges with increasingly strong demand for computing resources. Cloud computing, as a model of providing resources on demand, can provide technical support for solving the above problems. Recommendation as a service (RaaS), which packaged the recommendation system as a service, has attracted extensive attention from the business community and academia. In this paper, the RaaS model based on emotion analysis and double labeling is proposed. In this model, we make full use of commodity description information and user comment text to explore users' emotional preference on the commodity attributes that is less considered in the existing recommendation models or algorithms. First, we extract the keywords by analyzing the commodity description and user behaviors to establish commodity intrinsic attribute labels and user preference labels. Second, we mine the user's comments through emotion analysis to establish the commodity feedback labels and user concern labels. Finally, the recommendation results for users are generated by calculating the similarity of above four types of labels. Experimental results show that the proposed model and its algorithms can improve the effect of recommendation.},

abstract = {Content providers (CPs) increasingly deploy network infrastructures that oftentimes reach up to the wireless network edge, i.e. base stations or small cells. Hence, they are interested in optimizing resource allocation and relevant performance metrics for that infrastructure. On the other hand, mobile apps featuring streaming content (e.g. video, music) come with social-networking and content-sharing capabilities among users. These need to be taken into account in resource allocation since they decisively shape content demand. In this work, we introduce mathematical optimization problems about resource allocation at the wireless network edge, which obtain interesting twists when social-network diffusion is considered. Specifically, we consider, (i) the problem of content caching and user targeting through the recommender system of the app, with the goal to maximize the social diffusion effect of cached content, and (ii) the problem of user targeting through the mobile app recommender system, so that the available wireless bandwidth is utilized as efficiently as possible.},

In this paper, we propose a new model RNN-BPNNCM to predict user's next consumption behavior and then we recommend predicted item to the user. First, we use recurrent neural networks to analyze three kinds of behavior sequences to figure out three kinds of probabilities for every possible item. Then we use back propagation neural networks to figure out final probability. Finally, we take the top items with highest final probabilities as items that user will most likely consume next time and we recommend them to the user. RNN-BPNNCM solves the above problems of temporal context, recurrent pattern, and multiple user behaviors.

abstract = {Current QoS-aware automatic service composition queries over a network of web services are often one-time in nature. After a network of web services is built, such queries are issued once, and answers are found from the scratch. The underlying assumption is that the participating web services are rather static, which means that their functional and non-functional parameters seldom change. However, such an assumption is often baseless. New services come and go, service APIs change gradually, and QoS values fluctuate in practice. Therefore, a support for efficiently adapting service composition is desired. In this paper, we propose an event driven continuous query algorithm to intelligently cope with different types of dynamic services, and thus enable evolution of service composition. Evaluation using both real QoS data and synthetic web service data shows its superior performance, compared with the state-of-the-art solution which won the performance championship of Web Service Challenge in 2009 and 2010. Moreover, we generalize a new graph problem: dynamic single-source optimal-Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) problem based on the above work. It is argued that API recommendation for framework evolution, as another typical application, could also be modeled and addressed efficiently using the proposed new graph approach.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been recognized as an effective way to deal with the information overload problem, which can recommend accurate and positive items to users from a large volume of choices. Due to its capability and simplicity, collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most popular techniques for recommender systems. However, CF suffers from three issues which are user cold-start, item cold-start and data sparsity problems. These issues severely degrade the performance of CF. To address these issues, a hybrid collaborative filtering recommendation model, termed TrustCF, is proposed in this paper, based on user-item ratings and trust relations among users. TrustCF integrates ratings from trusted friends and similar users, ratings of similar items, item reputation and user history ratings. In particular, we modify the similarity calculation formula, considering the effect of the number of co-ratings. Trust relations among users are used to make predictions. In this way, TrustCF can alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the recommendation performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed TrustCF model and show TrustCF has better recommendation accuracy than other five counterparts.},

Compared with explicit feedback evaluation scores, implicit feedback data are easier to obtain but pose challenges to MF recommendation systems because of the transformation procedures from raw data to user preference scores. Another challenge for MF recommendation systems is the accuracy issue when the speed of the new input data increases. The proposed RI-SGD is designed for computationally-efficient and accurate time-variant implicit feedback MF recommendation system, which consists of alternating least squares with weight regularization in the training phase and stochastic gradient descent in the updating phase. To demonstrate the advantages of the RI-SGD updating technique in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, we implement the proposed updating techniques in a real-time music recommendation system. Compared with the method of retraining the entire model, our numerical results show that RI-SGD approach can achieve almost the same recommendation accuracy, but requires only about 0.02% of the retraining time.},

The results show that, two out of five query songs, the audiences felt that the recommended clips from the proposed system are more similar to queries. Since our system uses only 'onsets' for similarity measure, as opposed to both temporal and spectral features in other systems, to determine the similarity of audio clips the subjective results confirm that onset information is an important factor to determine the similarity of two audio clips. Thus, a music recommendation system might include the onset features for computing similarity scores.},

The accuracy can be improved with a better travel-tweet training dataset as well as a better travel category identification technique using machine learning. The travel categories can be increased to include items like sports venues, musical events, entertainment, etc. and thereby fine-tune the recommendations.

Current music recommendation systems are facing two key challenges: (1) users' listening habits with respect to time haven't been well studied; (2) there are far less ratings than listening records in music providing systems. In this paper, we strive to address the above two challenges. We investigate when and what music will a user listen to, and we propose a Fine-grained Time-Aware Music Recommendation (FTAMR) model. To be specific, we improve recommendation qualities from two sides: The user and the song. From the user's side, we study users' listening time-behavior in a fine-grained way and explore their short-Term listening habits (e.g. in a day) and long-Term listening habits (e.g. in several months); From the song's side, considering the sparsity of ratings and the characteristics (e.g., popularity) of each song, we define the asymmetric co-recommendation probability from a song to another, and cluster songs according to co-recommendation probabilities instead of similarities. Given users' listening records with time stamps, we make recommendation based on their listening habits and songs' co-recommendation probabilities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed FTAMR model, we study the Last.fm data set and conduct extensive experiments. The results show that our approach can provide better recommendations.},

abstract = {While the health benefits of regular physical activity are well-established, many people exercise much less than is recommended by established guidelines. Music has been shown to have a motivational effect that can encourage people to exercise more strenuously or for longer periods of time, but the determination of which songs should be provided to which exercisers is an unsolved problem. We propose a system that incorporates user profiling to provide a strong set of initial recommendations to the user. Reinforcement learning is then used as each recommendation is accepted or rejected in order to ensure that subsequent recommendations are also likely to be approved. Test subjects who used the proposed system rated the playlists it provided more highly than those provided by a prior state-of-the-art reinforcement learning-based music recommendation system and also did not need to reject as many songs before being satisfied with their recommendations, both when receiving recommendations based on individual profiles, and when receiving recommendations based on aggregate profiles formed by grouping the users.},

abstract = {Along with the rise of Event-Based Social Networks (EBSNs), event recommendation has become an increasing important problem. However, unlike recommending usual items, such as movies or music, event recommendation suffers from severe cold-start problem, because most events in EBSNs are typically short-lived and registered by only a few users. Additionally, the available feedbacks for events are implicit feedbacks. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Deep Neural Networks Collaborative Filtering Architecture (HDNN-CF) that collaboratively makes use of the events' semantic information and users' implicit feedbacks for event recommendation. Specifically, we extend state-of-The-Art method AutoRec to model implicit feedbacks by proposing Probabilistic AutoRec (PAutoRec). We collaboratively train a Stacked Denoise AutoEncoder (SDAE) to learn the deep representation of the semantic information and a PAutoRec to collaborative filter based on implicit feedbacks. Extensive experiments on a real large scale dataset Meetup show that HDNN-CF significantly outperforms state-of-The-Art methods by 10% on recall of top 30 recommendations.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel collaborative filtering recommender system based on an opportunistic distributed network. Collaborative filtering algorithms are widely used in many online systems. Often, the computation of these recommender systems is performed on a central server, controlled by the provider, requiring constant internet connection for gathering and computing data. However, in many scenarios, such constraints cannot be guaranteed or may not even be desired. This work proposes a recommendation engine where users share information via an opportunistic network independent of a dedicated internet connection. In this framework, each node is responsible for gathering information from nearby nodes and calculating its own recommendations. Using a centralized collaborative filtering recommender as a baseline, we evaluate three simulated scenarios composed by different movement speeds and data exchange parameters. Our results show that in a relatively short time, an opportunistic distributed recommender systems can achieve results similar to a traditional central system. Our analysis shows that the speed at which the opportunistic recommender system stabilizes depends on several factors including density of the users, movement speed and patterns of the users, and transmission strategies.},

The focus region is north of Portugal, developed around a location (urban or rural) or path (e.g. Portuguese Santiago Route or Douro) or around a theme (e.g. musician, writer). Points of Interest (POI) will be modeled. Also, the system is able to use different platforms for the tourist (desktop, notebook, tablet, Smartphone). TheRoute has been developed considering the notion of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) and Context Awareness. It consists of a context-aware touristic recommendation system which can suggest a series of locations to a user based on their personality, preferences, and location. This paper focuses on the proposed route generation processes, including examples of the overall resulting behavior. We discuss two proposed algorithms (an iterative branch-and-bound based process & sequential addition of the nearest feasible sub-route) for route generation, considering contextual model designing based on user's psychology, and point of interest and availability. The route generation tests that were performed included some of the most influential Porto points of interest.},

Our music player contains three modules: Emotion Module, Music Classification Module and Recommendation Module. The Emotion Module takes an image of the user's face as an input and makes use of deep learning algorithms to identify their mood with an accuracy of 90.23%. The Music Classification Module makes use of audio features to achieve a remarkable result of 97.69% while classifying songs into 4 different mood classes. The Recommendation Module suggests songs to the user by mapping their emotions to the mood type of the song, taking into consideration the preferences of the user.},

abstract = {With the growing popularity of online social platforms, it has been universally recognized that incorporating social relations into recommender systems can usually alleviate the problem of data sparsity. However, social recommender systems based on explicit relations are not as successful as expected due to the noise and the social cold issue of explicit social links. The intuition of utilizing explicit relations is that users share similar preferences if they are friends in the social network. In fact, quite a lot of users who are distant from each other in the social network also have similar tastes. The user item network and the user social network can provide useful information that can complement each other, so that exploring the implicit friends using the heterogeneous network they formed would be more helpful. In this paper, we propose an approach IFSR to discover implicit friends over the heterogeneous network to improve the performance of social recommendation. To find out reliable implicit ties, we first model the system as a heterogeneous network upon which both the preferences and social information are coupled. Over the HIN, similarities between each pair of users can be quantified through network embedding based representation learning. To reduce the computational cost while preserving the information embedded in the original networks and uncover the latent information hiding in the HIN, several meaningful meta-paths over the HIN are designed to guide the process of random walks. Finally, the Top-K implicit friends are incorporated into a social Bayesian ranking model to enhance the performance of item ranking. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate IFSR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and illustrate why the implicit friends are advantageous for social recommendation.},

We formulate this as a new problem in the context of index coding: we relax the index coding requirements to capture scenarios where each client has preferences associated with messages. The client is satisfied to receive any message she does not already have, with a satisfaction proportional to her preference for that message. We consistently find, over a number of scenarios we sample, that although the optimization problems are in general NP-hard, significant bandwidth savings are possible even when restricted to polynomial time algorithms.},

abstract = {Most of the existing music recommendation systems use collaborative or content based recommendation engines. However, the music choice of a user is not only dependent to the historical preferences or music contents. But also dependent to the mood of that user. This paper proposes an emotion based music recommendation framework that learns the emotion of a user from the signals obtained via wearable physiological sensors. In particular, the emotion of a user is classified by a wearable computing device which is integrated with a galvanic skin response (GSR) and photo plethysmography (PPG) physiological sensors. This emotion information is feed to any collaborative or content based recommendation engine as a supplementary data. Thus, existing recommendation engine performances can be increased using these data. Therefore, in this paper emotion recognition problem is considered as arousal and valence prediction from multi-channel physiological signals. Experimental results are obtained on 32 subjects' GSR and PPG signal data with/out feature fusion using decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors algorithms. The results of comprehensive experiments on real data confirm the accuracy of the proposed emotion classification system that can be integrated to any recommendation engine.},

In this paper, a novel method that realizes these applications simultaneously on the basis of heterogeneous network analysis via latent link estimation is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to realize music video recommendation, captioning and generation simultaneously. The proposed method enables latent link estimation with consideration of multimodal information and multiple social metadata obtained from music videos via Laplacian multiset canonical correlation analysis. Thus, it becomes feasible to construct a heterogeneous network that enables direct comparison of audio, visual and textual information of music videos and user information on the same feature space. Furthermore, link prediction on the obtained heterogeneous network enables association with (i) user information and their desired audio information; (ii) audio information and textual information that describes contents of musical pieces; and (iii) audio information and visual information that represents contents of musical pieces visually. As a result, support for (i) music video recommendation; (ii) captioning; and (iii) generation becomes feasible, respectively. Experimental results for a real-world dataset constructed by using YouTube-8M show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Item-to-item collaborative filtering (aka.item-based CF) has been long used for building recommender systems in industrial settings, owing to its interpretability and efficiency in real-time personalization. It builds a user's profile as her historically interacted items, recommending new items that are similar to the user's profile. As such, the key to an item-based CF method is in the estimation of item similarities. Early approaches use statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Pearson coefficient to estimate item similarities, which are less accurate since they lack tailored optimization for the recommendation task. In recent years, several works attempt to learn item similarities from data, by expressing the similarity as an underlying model and estimating model parameters by optimizing a recommendation-aware objective function. While extensive efforts have been made to use shallow linear models for learning item similarities, there has been relatively less work exploring nonlinear neural network models for item-based CF. In this work, we propose a neural network model named Neural Attentive Item Similarity model (NAIS) for item-based CF. The key to our design of NAIS is an attention network, which is capable of distinguishing which historical items in a user profile are more important for a prediction. Compared to the state-of-the-art item-based CF method Factored Item Similarity Model (FISM) [1] , our NAIS has stronger representation power with only a few additional parameters brought by the attention network. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of NAIS. This work is the first attempt that designs neural network models for item-based CF, opening up new research possibilities for future developments of neural recommender systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on event detection over the timeline of a music track. Such technology is motivated by the need for innovative applications such as searching, nonlinear access, and recommendation. Event detection over the timeline requires time-code level labels in order to train machine learning models. We use timed comments from SoundCloud, a modern social music sharing platform, to obtain these labels. While in this way the need for tedious and time-consuming manual labeling can be reduced, the challenge is that timed comments are subject to additional temporal noise, as they occur in the temporal neighborhood of the actual events. We investigate the utility of such noisy timed comments as training labels through a case study, in which we investigate three types of events in electronic dance music (EDM): drop, build, and break. These socially significant events play a key role in an EDM track's unfolding and are popular in social media circles. These events are interesting for detection, and here we leverage the timed comments generated in the course of the online social activity around them. We propose a two-stage learning method that relies on noisy timed comments and, given a music track, marks the events on the timeline. In the experiments, we focus, in particular, on investigating to which extent noisy timed comments can replace manually acquired expert labels. The conclusions we draw during this study provide useful insights that motivate further research in the field of event detection.},

With the advancement and increase in volume of digital content, the choice for people to listen to diverse type of music has also increased significantly. Thus, the necessity of delivering the most suited music to the listeners has been an interesting field of research in computer science. One of the important measures to deliver the best music to listeners could be their personality traits. In order to determine the personality traits of a person, social media like Facebook can be a useful platform where people express their views on different matters, share their opinions and thoughts. This paper first describes the use of Naive Bayes classifier to determine the standard Big Five Personality Traits of a person based on their status updates on Facebook profile using basic natural language processing techniques, and then proceeds to present the use of thus obtained information about personality traits to enhance the widely implemented user-to-user collaborative filtering techniques for music recommendation.},

abstract = {Whether it be through a problematic related to information ranking (e.g. search engines) or content recommendation (on social networks for instance), algorithms are at the core of processes selecting which information is made visible. Those algorithmic choices have in turn a strong impact on users activity and therefore on their access to information. This raises the question of measuring the quality of the choices made by algorithms and their impact on the users. As a first step into that direction, this paper presents a framework to analyze the diversity of the information accessed by the users. By depicting the activity of the users as a tripartite graph mapping users to products and products to categories, we analyze how categories catch users attention and in particular how this attention is distributed. We then propose the (calibrated) herfindahl diversity score as a metric quantifying the extent to which this distribution is diverse and representative of the existing categories. In order to validate this approach, we study a dataset recording the activity of users on online music platforms. We show that our score enables to discriminate between very specific categories that capture dense and coherent sub-groups of listeners, and more generic categories that are distributed on a wider range of users. Besides, we highlight the effect of the volume of listening on users attention and reveal a saturation effect above a certain threshold.},

Books, movies and television dramas are a few other media but, in contrast to these, music delivers its message in mere moments. It can aid us when we are feeling low and empower us. When we listen to sad songs, we tend to feel a decline in mood. When we listen to happy songs, we feel happier. Manual classification of songs based on mood, for making of a playlist, is time consuming and labour intensive. Our paper proposes a system 'EmoPlayer', an Android application, which help to minimize these efforts by suggesting the user a list of songs based on his current emotion. The system captures user's image using camera and detects his face. It then detects the emotion and makes a list of songs which will enhance his mood as the songs keep playing. EmoPlayer uses Viola Jones algorithm for face detection and Fisherfaces classifier for emotion classification.},

However, these two prediction tasks are always coupled with each other, where users' preferences will influence the formation of users' interaction in coupled social networks, and vice versa. In this paper, we proposed a multitasking factor graph model (MFG) for predicting the user interaction and links between users and items simultaneously. Firstly, we observed some interesting network transfer structures according to the feature analysis between the user-user network and user-item network. Sequently, we developed a MFG model based on these network transfer structure, which can transfer information mutually from one network to the other to solve the multitasking prediction problem.

The incompleteness of massive data in the IoT is widespread. Obtaining personalized information from the incomplete data set is still puzzled by searching efficient and accurate methods at present. Skyline query is a widely used data processing method, especially in the field of multi-objective decision analysis and data visualization. To eliminate the negative effects on massive data processing in IoT, a novel skyline preference query strategy based on massive and the incomplete data set is proposed in this paper. This strategy simply separates and divides massive and incomplete data set into two parts according to dimension importance and executes skyline query, respectively. The strategy mainly resolves the problem of extracting personalized information from massive and incomplete data set and improves the efficiency of skyline query on massive and incomplete data set. First, this paper presents a skyline preference query strategy based on strict clustering and implements it on dimensions that have higher importance. Second, a skyline preference query strategy based on loose clustering is implemented on dimensions that have lower importance. Finally, integrating local skyline query results, this paper calculates global skyline query results by using information entropy theory. The efficiency and effectiveness of Skyline Preference Query (SPQ) algorithm have been evaluated in terms of response time and result set size through the comparative experiments with ISkyline algorithm and sort-based incomplete data skyline algorithm. A large number of simulation results show that the efficiency of SPQ algorithm is higher than that of other common methods.},

The proposed link prediction algorithm predicts the links that are most likely to be formed in the network based on two new proposed metrics. These metrics take into account the effects of both the network structure and the attribute information of the items for predicting probable links. The links predicted can be presented as recommendations to the user. An item network consisting of item associations derived from the attribute information usually displays a community structure with items of similar nature being clustered together. Our approach utilises this community structure to expose implicit links in the item network and provides non-obvious recommendations to the user.},

However, the event recommendation problem is rather challenging because it faces a serious cold-start problem: Events have short life time and new events are registered by only a few users. What's more, there are only implicit feedback information. Existing approaches like collaborative filtering methods are not suitable for this scenario. In this paper, we propose a Context Aware Matrix Factorization model called AlphaMF to tackle with the problem. Specifically, AlphaMF is a unified model that combines the Matrix Factorization model which models implicit feedbacks with the Linear contextual features model which models explicit contextual features. Extensive experiments on a large real-world EBSN dataset demonstrate that the AlphaMF model significantly outperforms state-of-The-Art methods by 11%.},

RSs are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, social tags, user group and products as Web services evoked on the Internet either as mobile Apps or PC-based applications. However, it is challenging to achieve personalized recommendations instead of offering up too many lowest common denominator recommendations. Understanding how products relate to each other is important because it has great impact on the performance. Furthermore, the personalized sequential behavior, which is closely related to a particular product, is essential for recommender systems. Most models simply integrate features from users and items without considering potential product bundle relationships between products exposed by users' personalized sequential behaviors. In this paper, a novel method based on Factorizing Personalized Markov Chain (FPMC) is proposed to comprehensively explore the latent bundle relations from users perspective, along with the hidden correlative semantics between products obtained from logic regression method, which provides a unified view to describe the user preferences, product/item features, and the user sequential patterns in timely manner. The involved semantic features are extracted using deep learning models. We evaluate our method on real-world Amazon datasets and our framework significantly outperforms other baseline models, especially on sparse datasets.

This method cannot only improve the accuracy of the recommendations, but also reduce the running time. Furthermore, the Internet users may have many different interests. For example, they may be interested in sports videos, and at the same time also enjoy watching political videos. For this reason, we propose a complement algorithm based on hyperlink-graph model for video recommendations. This algorithm is based on the principles of min-Hash. It realizes the cross clustering in user layers and further improves the accuracy of personalized video recommendations.},

Diversely from items in traditional recommendation scenarios (e.g. movies, songs), events in EBSNs are only valid for a short period of time, having no explicit feedback. Therefore the event recommendation problem is essentially cold-start. To overcome this limitation, CPERS combines content preferences and context influences derived from users' historical events. In particular, besides content preference based on events' description, CPERS exploits temporal impact from users' time preference, spatial constraints based upon geographical preference, cost consideration derived from expenditure history and social influence from social relationship between hosts and users. Furthermore, CPERS integrates the above factors to rank events for personalized recommendation. We collect a real-world dataset from a popular EBSNs called 'Douban Events', and the experimental results on the dataset demonstrate that CPERS improves recommendation performance.},

@article{niu2017temporal,
abstract = {As an important cyber-enabled application, online video recommendation is seeing significant interest from both industry and academia. To effectively recommend video content becomes a popular research topic. However, it has been found that existing recommendation methods based on video affective analysis ignore the temporal factor, leading to poor performance especially when the order of emotion components does affect the recommendation quality. This motivates us to study the feature of emotion fluctuation, which we call Temporal Factor of Emotion (TFE). In this paper, a novel recommendation method based on the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is proposed to tackle this problem. GRA preserves the temporal factor of objects during analysis and is suitable for analyzing systems with unknown correlation (a set of independent videos). In our work, first, specific video features are extracted and mapped to the well-known Lovheim emotion-space, through the SVMs (Support Vector Machine). Then, GRA is applied to compute the quantitative relation among videos by using extracted emotions as factors. Finally, a pick-filter pattern and GRA-based recommendation method under the Fisher model are proposed. To evaluate the performance of our method, an online video recommendation system is developed. Experimental results of both user study and parameter evaluation demonstrate that the GRA-based method can improve accuracy of video affective analysis and performance of video recommendation.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have attracted much attention in last decades, which can help the users explore new items in many applications. As a popular technique in recommender systems, item recommendation works by recommending items to users based on their historical interactions. Conventional item recommendation methods usually assume that users and items are stationary, which is not always the case in real-world applications. Many time-aware item recommendation models have been proposed to take the temporal effects into the considerations based on the absolute time stamps associated with observed interactions. We show that using absolute time to model temporal effects can be limited in some circumstances. In this work, we propose to model the temporal dynamics of both users and items in item recommendation based on their life cycles. This problem is very challenging to solve since the users and items can co-evolve in their life cycles and the sparseness of the data become more severe when we consider the life cycles of both users and items. A novel time-aware item recommendation model called BiCycle is proposed to address these challenges. BiCycle is designed based on two important observations: 1) correlated users or items usually share similar patterns in the similar stages of their life cycles. 2) user preferences and item characters can evolve gradually over different stages of their life cycles. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of recommendation tasks by considering the inner life cycles of both users and items.},

With the development of social platforms, incorporating abundant social relationships into recommenders can help to overcome this issue, because users' preferences can be inferred from those of their friends. Most existing social recommenders are based on matrix factorization, a collaborative filtering model that has been proven to be effective. In this paper, we introduce a novel social recommender based on the idea that distance reflects likability. Compared with matrix factorization, the proposed model enables us to obtain a spatial understanding of the latent factor space and how users and items are positioned inside the space by combining the factorization model and distance metric learning. In our method, users and items are initially mapped into a unified low-dimensional space. The positions of users and items are jointly determined by ratings and social relations, which can help to determine appropriate locations for users who have few ratings. Finally, the learned metrics and positions are used to generate understandable and reliable recommendations. Experiments conducted on real-world data sets have shown that compared with methods based on only matrix factorization, our method significantly improves the recommendation accuracy.},

By applying a density-based spatial clustering algorithm, we identify nine clusters which reflect similar users regarding both their musical preference and cultural background. Our findings show that cultural aspects cannot be approximated by GPS coordinates and that incorporating cultural characteristics allows for more precise user characterization.

With the advent and popularity of online social networks, some studies on network-based recommendation have emerged, raising the concern of many researchers. Trust is one kind of important information available in social networks and is often used for performance improvement in social-network-based RSs. However, most trust-aware RSs ignore the fact that people trust different subsets of friends pertaining to different domains, such as music and movies, because people behave differently in diverse domains according to different interests. This paper proposes a novel recommendation method called TruCom. In a multicategory item recommendation domain, TruCom first generates a domain-specific trust network pertaining to each domain and then builds a unified objective function for improving recommendation accuracy by incorporating the hybrid information of direct and indirect trust into a matrix factorization recommendation model. Through relevant benchmark experiments on two real-world data sets, we show that TruCom achieves better performance than other existing recommendation methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of TruCom.},

abstract = {Recommender systems play an essential role in providing users with accurate and positive items or services for their personalized preferences from large volume of information choices. Collaborative filtering (CF) is an indispensable technique of recommender systems and widely applied in many areas such as e-commerce, social medium and review sites. However, CF suffers from three issues which are cold start users, cold start items and data sparsity. These issues severely degrade the recommendation performance of CF. To address these issues, we propose TrustTR, a novel memory-based recommendation model based on trust relations and item ratings. TrustTR integrates trusted friends' recommendations, item reputation and user history ratings to improve the recommendation performance. Especially, we calculate the user reputation based on trust relations and ratings information to supply the insufficient item ratings. Thus, TrustTR can alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the quality of recommendations for cold start users. Besides, we utilize item reputation as one of the recommendation factors to mitigate the problem of cold start items. Finally, the experimental results from a real-world dataset show that our method can produce better predictive accuracy compared with other five counterparts recommendation models.},

These systems have been introducing various recommender algorithms into their platforms to filter information from their voluminous databases. These recommendation engines help users to save time by providing them with results that suite their taste. Researchers and software engineers have developed numerous algorithms to recommend items more accurately however, very little research have been done on the scope of music recommendation using social data. Orthodox methods of recommendation utilized ratings supplied by users to each item as the basis of recommendation. The accuracy of prediction is significantly affected when ratings are not provided for some items or when the user is new to the platform and has not rated any item yet. It is also difficult to recommend new items that have not yet being rated yet. This problem is termed 'cold start'. In order to eliminate this problem we propose the Collaborative Filtering (CF) using Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) and a Bayesian Nonparametric Model (BNM). A comprehensive experiment on music and social datasets from different source indicates a higher accuracy of prediction and performance.},

We formulate this as a new problem in the context of index coding: we relax the index coding requirements to capture scenaria where each client has preferences associated with messages. The client is satisfied to receive any message she does not already have, with a satisfaction proportional to her preference for that message. We consistently find, over a number of scenaria we sample, that although the optimization problems are in general NP-hard, significant bandwidth savings are possible even when restricted to polynomial time algorithms.},

Companies, data scientists, and researchers are trying to infer meaningful information from this vast amount of data. One of the most important target applications is to find influential people in these networks. This information can serve many purposes such as; user or content recommendation, viral marketing, and user modeling. Social media is divided into subcategories like where one can share photos (i.e. Instagram, Flickr), video or music (i.e. Youtube, Last.fm), restaurant suggestions like Foursquare, or text like Twitter. Twitter is more of an idea and news sharing media than other types of social media and it has a huge amount of public profiles. These features of Twitter make it a more interesting and valuable media to research on. In this paper, we are addressing to identify topical authorities/influential users in Twitter. We provide a novel representation of users' topical interests called focus rate. We incorporate nodal features into network features and introduce a modified version of Pagerank algorithm which efficiently analyzes topical influence of users. Experimental results show that focus rate of users on specific topics increase their influence scores and lead to higher information diffusion. We use also distributed computing environment which enables to work with large data sets. We demonstrate our results on Turkish Twitter messages. For the best of our knowledge, this is the first influence analysis on Twitter that is conducted for Turkish language.},

@article{chen2016recommendation,
abstract = {Recommender system has been studied as a useful tool to discover novel items for users while fitting their personalized interest. Thus, the previously consumed items are usually out of consideration due to the 'lack' of novelty. However, as time elapses, people may forget those previously consumed and preferred items which could become 'novel' again. Meanwhile, repeat consumption accounts for a major portion of people's observed activities; examples include: eating regularly at a same restaurant, or repeatedly listening to the same songs. Therefore, we believe that recommending repeat consumption will have a real utility at certain times. In this paper, we formulate the problem of recommendation for repeat consumption with user implicit feedback. A time-sensitive personalized pairwise ranking (TS-PPR) method based on user behavioral features is proposed to address this problem. The proposed method factorizes the temporal user-item interactions via learning the mappings from the behavioral features in observable space to the preference features in latent space, and combines users' static and dynamic preferences together in recommendation. An empirical study on real-world data sets shows encouraging results.},

Recommender systems have been proven to be valuable tools to deal with information overload and be able to provide appropriate recommendations to users. The cloud environment is dynamic and uncertain, which makes the quality of cloud services time-sensitive. However, most existing recommender systems did not take temporal influence into consideration, therefore could not accommodate the dynamic cloud environment. In view of this challenge, we propose a temporal-aware hybrid collaborative recommendation method for cloud service. It aims at providing users with appropriate recommendations from time-sensitive cloud services. In our method, by distinguishing temporal QoS metrics from stable QoS metrics, temporal influence is integrated into classical neighborhood-based collaborative recommender algorithm. Besides, to get an optimal recommendation, a temporal-aware latent factor model based on tensor decomposition is proposed and combined to improve the recommendation performance. Finally, experiments are designed and conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.},

Owing to this interdependence, the advertiser can push corresponding products to users according to location recommendations, i.e., advertisement targeting. To achieve this mobile cloud computing service, after moving the computing capacity away from end devices to data centres (DCs), the converged infrastructure integrating optical metro and ubiquitous wireless access technologies is proposed in accordance with the 5G model. To minimize energy consumption, we propose a novel design framework of location-recommendation-aware virtual network embedding. This design framework determines the interdependency among user groups so that we can embed the virtual networks owned by user groups with a high interdependence into the same DC of the substrate optical-wireless hybrid infrastructure. Thus, the adviser can locally push the corresponding products to user groups at a single DC instead of consuming a large amount of energy to build inter-DC paths. The simulation results show that our design framework has greater energy efficiency and more profitable advertisement targeting compared with the benchmark, and the result of our heuristic is very close to the upper bound.},

abstract = {Being able to automatically and quickly understand the user context during a session is a main issue for recommender systems. As a first step toward achieving that goal, we propose a model that observes in real time the diversity brought by each item relatively to a short sequence of consultations, corresponding to the recent user history. Our model has a complexity in constant time, and is generic since it can apply to any type of items within an online service (e.g. profiles, products, music tracks) and any application domain (e-commerce, social network, music streaming), as long as we have partial item descriptions. The observation of the diversity level over time allows us to detect implicit changes. In the long term, we plan to characterize the context, i.e. to find common features among a contiguous sub-sequence of items between two changes of context determined by our model. This will allow us to make context-aware and privacy-preserving recommendations, to explain them to users. As this is an on-going research, the first step consists here in studying the robustness of our model while detecting changes of context. In order to do so, we use a music corpus of 100 users and more than 210,000 consultations (number of songs played in the global history). We validate the relevancy of our detections by finding connections between changes of context and events, such as ends of session. Of course, these events are a subset of the possible changes of context, since there might be several contexts within a session. We altered the quality of our corpus in several manners, so as to test the performances of our model when confronted with sparsity and different types of items. The results show that our model is robust and constitutes a promising approach.},

Context-aware music delivery systems succeed in delivering suitable music according to the situation through the process of music mood-mapping which identifies the mood of a song. Additionally, we can leverage the power of the cloud to enable crowd sensing of the mood-mapping of various songs and enhance the effectiveness of situation-aware music delivery for drivers. The cloud can be used to aggregate the crowd sensed music mood-mapping data and improve the effectiveness of music delivery by providing accurate mood-mappings from the aggregated data. Currently, context-aware music delivery systems consider only features from the song for music mood-mapping.

abstract = {The choice of music in everyday life is greatly influenced by contextual circumstances surrounding music listeners. Music lovers create music playlists for various contexts and activities they are engaged in, and this is done manually by updating and loading new playlist each time a user changes activity or context. This does not make music listening enjoyable as much time and effort is spent on searching for songs that befit the current context and activity. This paper proposes a personalized context-aware music recommendation system, called MPlist, that dynamically and automatically creates a music playlist for music lovers based on their context (i.e., current location and activity), listening preference, nearby users listening profiles, other users listening preferences and music from labels and tags mined from music experts and the web. MPlist collects data from multiple sensors in a user's smart mobile device and uses them to infer the user's context and activity, thereby generating a playlist based on contextual preference. This approach has the advantage of solving the well-known cold start problem yet giving music lovers a personalized anywhere anytime music listening experience. MPlist classifier is built using both kNN and rule-based learning algorithms using sensor datasets and context-aware listening profile dataset. The context-analytic engine infers basic user activities and sends all the inferred content to the content provider so that the server can learn the music preferences given a particular context. The system exhibit performance as follows: accuracy is 0.944, F-measure is 0.945, and RMSE is 0.0978. This tends to suggest that context-aware music recommendation systems is probably what music lover expect from music stores.},

abstract = {Providing personalized content on smartphones is significant in ensuring user experience and making mobile applications profitable. The existing approaches mostly ignore the rich personalized information from user interaction with smartphones. In this paper, we address the issue of recommending personalized music to smartphone users and propose Smart-DJ. Smart-DJ incorporates an evolutionary model called Incremental Regression Tree, which incrementally collects contextual data, music data and user feedback to characterize his/her personal taste of music. An efficient recommending algorithm is designed to make accurate recommendations within bounded latency. We implement Smart-DJ and evaluate its performance through analysis and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that Smart-DJ outperforms the state-of-arts approaches in terms of recommendation accuracy and overhead.},

Considering the influence of temporal context and hierarchical structure on emotion in music, we propose a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (DBLSTM) based multi-scale regression method. In this method, a post-processing component is utilised for individual DBSLTM output to further enhance the ability of temporal context processing and a fusion component is to integrate the output of all DBLSTM models with different scales. In addition, we investigate how the difference of sequence length between the training and predicting phase affects the performance of DBLSTM. We conduct our experiments on a public database of Emotion in Music task at MediaEval 2015, and the result shows that our method achieves significant improvement when compared with the state-of-art methods.},

abstract = {Inferring potential links is a fundamental problem in social networks. In the link recommendation problem, the aim is to suggest a list of potential people to each user, ordered by the preferences of the user. Although various approaches have been developed to solve this problem, the difficulty of producing a ranking list with high precision at the top - the most important consideration for real world applications - remains largely an open problem. In this work, we propose two top-k link recommendation algorithms which focus on optimizing the top ranked links. For this purpose, we define a cost-sensitive ranking loss which penalizes the mistakes at the top of a ranked list more than the mistakes at the bottom. In particular, we propose a log loss, derive its surrogate, and formulate a top-k link recommendation model by optimizing this surrogate loss function based upon latent features. Moreover, we extend this top-k link recommendation model by incorporating both the latent features and explicit features of the network. Finally, an efficient learning scheme to learn the model parameters is provided. We conduct empirical studies based upon four real world datasets, i.e., Wikipedia, CondMat, Epinions, and MovieLens 1M, of which the largest network contains more than 70 thousand nodes and over one million links. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, microblogging is increasingly becoming an important platform for users to acquire information and publish some reviews or personal status. In microblogging, hash tags mean some topic words between two '#', such as some social events or some hot topics. Hash tags can highlight the topic of tweets, and make tweets be easily searched and understood by others. Therefore, many users like adding hash tags for their tweets. Existing hash tag recommendation methods always consider semantic similarity between hash tags and tweets as the only key factor. However, the hash tags' user acceptance degree and development tendency are two important factors for evaluate the recommendation probability of them. In this paper, we propose a model for recommending some related hash tags for users to choose one or more of them as content added into forthcoming tweets. The above three factors have been considered to complete this task, which are the semantic similarity between a hash tag and a tweet, the user acceptance degree of the hash tag, and the development tendency of the hash tag. Experimental results on a dataset from Sina Weibo, one of the largest Chinese microblogging websites, show usefulness of the proposed model for recommending hash tags to forthcoming tweets.},

Behavior of music listening is continuous and repetitive process, especially, the latest song listening can infer to the favorite song at that moment.

abstract = {Social tagging systems (STSs) allow users to annotate information items (songs, pictures, etc.) to provide them item/tag or even user recommendations. STSs consist of three main types of entities: 1) users; 2) items; and 3) tags. These data usually are represented by a three-order tensor, on which Tucker decomposition (TD) models are performed, such as higher order singular value decomposition. However, TD models require cubic computations for the tensor decomposition. Furthermore, TD models suffer from sparsity that incurs in social tagging data. Thus, TD models have limited applicability to large-scale datasets, due to their computational complexity and data sparsity. In this paper, we use two different ways to compute similarity/distance between tags (i.e., the term frequency - inverse document frequency vector space model and the semantic similarity of tags using the ontology of WordNet). Moreover, to reduce the size of the tensor's dimensions and its data sparsity, we use clustering methods (i.e., ${k}$ -means, spectral clustering, etc.) for discovering tag clusters, which are the intermediaries between a user's profile and items. Thus, instead of inserting the tag dimension in the tensor, we insert the tag cluster dimension, which is smaller and has less noise, resulting to better item recommendation accuracy. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against a state-of-the-art item recommendation algorithm with two real datasets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

This paper presents a novel clinical decision support tool that is capable of helping physicians make diagnostic decisions. We apply this support system to improve the specificity of breast cancer screening and diagnosis. The system utilizes clinical context (e.g., demographics, medical history) to minimize the false positive rates while avoiding false negatives. An online contextual learning algorithm is used to update the diagnostic strategy presented to the physicians over time. We analytically evaluate the diagnostic performance loss of the proposed algorithm, in which the true patient distribution is not known and needs to be learned, as compared with the optimal strategy where all information is assumed known, and prove that the false positive rate of the proposed learning algorithm asymptotically converges to the optimum. In addition, our algorithm also has the important merit that it can provide individualized confidence estimates about the accuracy of the diagnosis recommendation. Moreover, the relevancy of contextual features is assessed, enabling the approach to identify specific contextual features that provide the most value of information in reducing diagnostic errors. Experiments were conducted using patient data collected at a large academic medical center. Our proposed approach outperforms the current clinical practice by 36% in terms of false positive rate given a 2% false negative rate.},

While this practice protects users' privacy, it also creates highly sparse dataset, which in turn causes cold start problems in Recommender Systems (RS) and leads to poor prediction results. Contextual-aware recommender system (CARS) has been recognized as an efficient solution to address either a new user or a new item cold start scenario. It outperforms traditional collaborative filtering recommender systems. Most existing CARS solutions however have not provided efficient solutions for mixed cold start scenarios, in which two or more cold start problems co-exist. In this work, we introduce a Weighted Switching Hybrid Context-Aware (W-SHCA) Recommender System. It is based on two algorithms: Content-based CAMF-CC (Context-Aware Matrix Factorization) and Demographics-based CAMF-CC, and utilizes their weighted sum to perform the prediction when a mixed cold start problem is detected. We exploit the W-SHCA model in three recommendation applications: places of interest (STS), music (Music), and movie (CoMoDa). We illustrate some significant performance differences among these three datasets under various mixed cold start situations, and deduced a stable weight selection pattern for W-SHCA associating with dataset characteristics. We believe that this work is a pioneer in dealing with mixed cold-start problems, and would provide a vital reference point for their future research.},

In an attempt to recommend relevant songs to users, we propose an hybrid recommender that considers real-world users information and high-level representation for audio data. We use a deep learning technique, convolutional deep neural networks, to represent an audio segment in a n-dimensional vector, whose dimensions define the probability of the segment to belong to a specific music genre. To capture the listening behavior of a user, we investigate a state-of-the-art technique, estimation of distribution algorithms. The designed hybrid music recommender outperforms the predictions compared with a traditional content-based recommender.},

We specifically consider an antenna array with an imperfectly calibrated array response. The modified MUSIC algorithm estimates the DOA of each signal individually after attempting to null the other signals that are present. We compare the new approach to the conventional MUSIC algorithm in simulations, and show that the new approach leads to improved performance. The new approach converges quickly and produces DOA estimates with smaller mean error and standard deviation than MUSIC over a range of incident signal separations. We recommend our approach for systems with challenging antenna placements, a time varying host platform, and limited processing capabilities.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel large-scale, context-aware recommender system that provides accurate recommendations, scalability to a large number of diverse users and items, differential services, and does not suffer from "cold start" problems. Our proposed recommendation system relies on a novel algorithm which learns online the item preferences of users based on their click behavior, and constructs online item-cluster trees. The recommendations are then made by choosing an item-cluster level and then selecting an item within that cluster as a recommendation for the user. This approach is able to significantly improve the learning speed when the number of users and items is large, while still providing high recommendation accuracy. Each time a user arrives at the website, the system makes a recommendation based on the estimations of item payoffs by exploiting past context arrivals in a neighborhood of the current user's context. It exploits the similarity of contexts to learn how to make better recommendations even when the number and diversity of users and items is large. This also addresses the cold start problem by using the information gained from similar users and items to make recommendations for new users and items. We theoretically prove that the proposed algorithm for item recommendations converges to the optimal item recommendations in the long-run. We also bound the probability of making a suboptimal item recommendation for each user arriving to the system while the system is learning. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by over 20 percent in terms of click through rates.},

Our method relies on a novel type of multilayer graph that encodes the spreading or propagation of events between successive time steps. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it on three different real-world examples. First, we study how rumor spreads on a social network. Second, we reveal congestion patterns of pedestrians in a train station. Finally, we show how patterns of audio playlists can be used in a recommender system. In each example, relevant information previously hidden in the data is extracted in a very efficient manner, emphasizing the scalability of our method.

In LBSNs, identifying home locations of users is very important for various applications like effective location-based advertisement and recommendation. However, this problem is rather challenging because the location information in LBSNs is sparse and noisy: Only a small percentage of users share their home location information due to privacy concerns; users may check in at diverse places far from their home and make friends far away; many users even do not have any check-in information. In this paper, we propose a trust-based influence model, named as TSU to solve the problem. To be specific, TSU is a Trust-based unified probabilistic model that models edges in LBSNs based on signals from Social relationship data(social friendship, social trust) and User-centric data(check-in data) in LBSN. We proposed a Home Location Identification method based on TSU model and evaluate it on a large real-world LBSNs dataset.

To address this limitation, in this paper we explore leveraging geolocation and external information about restaurants to simplify the classification problem. We propose a framework incorporating discriminative classification in geolocalized settings and introduce the concept of geolocalized models, which, in our scenario, are trained locally at each restaurant location. In particular, we propose two strategies to implement this framework: geolocalized voting and combinations of bundled classifiers. Both models show promising performance, and the later is particularly efficient and scalable. We collected a restaurant-oriented food dataset with food images, dish tags, and restaurant-level information, such as the menu and geolocation. Experiments on this dataset show that exploiting geolocation improves around 30% the recognition performance, and geolocalized models contribute with an additional 3-8% absolute gain, while they can be trained up to five times faster.},

However, the metrics used in the sentiment analysis only classify a sentence with positive, neutral or negative intensity, and do not detect sentiment variations in accordance with the user's profile. In this arena, this paper presents a music recommendation system based on a sentiment intensity metric, named enhanced Sentiment Metric (eSM) that is the association of a lexicon-based sentiment metric with a correction factor based on the user's profile. This correction factor is discovered by means of subjective tests, conducted in a laboratory environment. Based on the experimental results, the correction factor is formulated and used to adjust the final sentiment intensity. The users' sentiments are extracted from sentences posted on social networks and the music recommendation system is performed through a framework of low complexity for mobile devices, which suggests songs based on the current user's sentiment intensity. Also, the framework was built considering ergonomic criteria of usability. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated with remote users using the crowdsourcing method, reaching a rating of 91% of user satisfaction, outperforming a randomly assigned song suggestion that reached 65% of user satisfaction. Furthermore, the paper presents low perceived impacts on the analysis of energy consumption, network and latency in accordance with the processing and memory perception of the recommendation system, showing advantages for the consumer electronic world.},

We model a singer's vocal competence as a singer profile, which takes voice pitch, intensity, and quality into consideration. Then we propose techniques to acquire singer profiles. We also present a song profile model which is used to construct a human annotated song database. Then we propose a learning-to-rank scheme for recommending songs by a singer profile.

Since messages posted by microblogging users reflect their interests, and the keywords in the messages indicate their main focus to a large extent, we can discover users' preferences by analyzing the user-generated contents. Moreover, users' interests are not static, on the contrary, they change as time goes by. Based on such intuitions, in this paper, we propose a temporal-topic model to analyze users' possible behaviors and predict their potential friends in microblogging. The model learns users' latent preferences by extracting keywords on aggregated messages over a period of time via a topic model, and then the impact of time is considered to deal with interest drifts. The experimental results of friend recommendations on Sina Weibo, one of the most popular microblogging sites in China, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.},

abstract = {Several paradigms for high-level music descriptions have been proposed to develop effective system for browsing and retrieving musical content in large repositories. Such paradigms are based on either categorical or dimensional models. The interest in dimensional models has recently grown a great deal, as they define a semantic relation between concepts through graded descriptions. One problem that affects semantic descriptions is the ambiguity that often arises from using the same descriptor in different contexts. In order to overcome this difficulty, it is important to model and address polysemy, which is the property of words to take on different meanings depending on the use-context. In this paper we propose a Dimensional Contextual Semantic Model for defining semantic relations among descriptors in a context-aware fashion. This model is here used for developing a semantic music search engine. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we compare this engine with two systems that are based on different description models.},

Hence, the ratings in a recommender system should have different recommended weights. Ratings in fields where in the user has high or low familiarity should be given high or low recommended weights, respectively. However, current recommendation algorithms ignore this problem and use the ratings indiscriminately, thus affecting the accuracy of the recommendation system. In this paper, we provide a focused study of user-familiarity degree-aware recommendation and develop a user-familiarity degree-aware latent factor model for recommendations that considers both user familiarity and item features reflected by the tagging information. We also design a user-familiarity degree-aware probability matrix factorization model, which computes the degree of familiarity of a user with the items he/she has rated. By using the user-familiarity degree, different recommended weights are given to every rating to obtain precise recommendations. The experiment results on real-world datasets show that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art latent factor models and effectively improves the accuracy of the recommendation results.},

abstract = {Evaluation is important to assess the performance of a computer system in fulfilling a certain user need. In the context of recommendation, researchers usually evaluate the performance of a recommender system by holding out a random subset of observed ratings and calculating the accuracy of the system in reproducing such ratings. This evaluation strategy, however, does not consider the fact that in a real-world setting we are actually given the observed ratings of the past and have to predict for the future. There might be new songs, which create the cold-start problem, and the users' musical preference might change over time. Moreover, the user satisfaction of a recommender system may be related to factors other than accuracy. In light of these observations, we propose in this paper a novel evaluation framework that uses various time-based data splitting methods and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of recommender systems. Using millions of listening records collected from a commercial music streaming service, we compare the performance of collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based (CB) models with low-level audio features and semantic audio descriptors. Our evaluation shows that the CB model with semantic descriptors obtains a better trade-off among accuracy, novelty, diversity, freshness and popularity, and can nicely deal with the cold-start problems of new songs.},

We identify the social features from three types of the users' information - demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location), social relations (i.e., friendship), and users' interests. The results reveal that the interest similarity follows the homophily principle. Particularly, the results show that two users are more likely to be alike in their interests 1) if they exhibit more similarity in their demographic characteristics (e.g., similar age, same gender, or close to each other geographically), or 2) if they are more intimate in their friendship, or 3) if they present a higher average interest individuality (i.e., a measurement for estimating the personalized characteristics of a user's interests). The empirical observations could be exploited to infer how two users are alike in their interests according to the social features, which could be further harnessed by various practical applications and services, such as recommendation system and advertisement service.},

Successful collaborative retrieval requires overcoming severe data sparsity, making additional sources of information, such as social graphs, particularly valuable.

The motivation is to apply molecular-based communications to challenging electromagnetic environments. We first derive a novel capture probability expression of a finite sized receiver. The paper then introduces the concept of time-aggregated molecular noise at the receiver as a function of the rate at which the sensor can self-cleanse. The resulting inter-symbol-interference is expressed as a function of the sensor cleanse time, and the performance metrics of bit error rate, throughput and round-trip-time are derived. The results show that the performance is very sensitive to the sensor cleanse time and the drift velocity.

@inproceedings{song2014clustering,
abstract = {A big challenge for the design and implementation of large-scale online services is determining what items to recommend to their users. For instance, Netflix makes movie recommendations; Amazon makes product recommendations; and Yahoo! makes webpage recommendations. In these systems, items are recommended based on the characteristics and circumstances of the users, which are provided to the recommender as contexts (e.g., search history, time, and location). The task of building an efficient recommender system is challenging due to the fact that both the item space and the context space are very large. Existing works either focus on a large item space without contexts, large context space with small number of items, or they jointly consider the space of items and contexts together to solve the online recommendation problem. In contrast, we develop an algorithm that does exploration and exploitation in the context space and the item space separately, and develop an algorithm that combines clustering of the items with information aggregation in the context space. Basically, given a user's context, our algorithm aggregates its past history over a ball centered on the user's context, whose radius decreases at a rate that allows sufficiently accurate estimates of the payoffs such that the recommended payoffs converge to the true (unknown) payoffs. Theoretical results show that our algorithm can achieve a sublinear learning regret in time, namely the payoff difference of the oracle optimal benchmark, where the preferences of users on certain items in certain context are known, and our algorithm, where the information is incomplete. Numerical results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms (over 48%) the existing algorithms in terms of regret. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

In detail, we firstly identify different topical sub-groups by topics in social networks. Secondly, different user factors are used to calculate the user influence (including individual and social) on the topical sub-groups, which can depict the topical sub-group characteristics in different points of view.

In recent times recommender systems, recommend everything from movies, books, music, restaurant, news to jokes. Collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms are one of the most successful recommendation techniques which present information on items and products that are according to user's interest. There are two methods in CF, user-based CF and item-based CF. Former finds a certain user's interests by finding other users who have similar interests whereas item based CF looks into a set of items rated by all users and computes how similar they are to the target item under recommendation. This paper aims to develop a model by splitting the costly computations in CF algorithms into three Map-Reduce phases. Further, each of these phases can be executed independently on different nodes in parallel. To compute the similarity, the Pearson correlation algorithm is used, which measures the how two items linearly relate to each other, giving a value between -1 and +1 inclusive. In addition, this paper compares the implementation of item based and user based CF algorithm on map-reduce framework. Experimental results showed that the running time of the algorithm improves by approximately 30% with every addition of a node, into a Hadoop cluster.

Aiming to overcome such limitations, we introduce a framework through which we extract dissimilarity features based on differences in preferences of items' attributes among users. We enrich the representations of items with the extracted features for the purpose of increasing the ability of a recommender to highlight the preferred items. In this direction, we incorporate the dissimilarity features into different types of classifiers/recommenders (C4.5 and lib-SVM) and evaluate their importance in terms of precision and relevance.

abstract = {Traditional recommender systems are designed to provide suggestions for individuals. However, there are scenarios in which groups of people are in need of decision support. For example, a group of friends want to choose a restaurant to have a dinner or to watch a movie together. In this paper, we propose a novel group recommendation algorithm for providing suggestions to groups. The proposed algorithm can be divided into two steps: the first step is to predict the preference of the unwatched items for each group members, which is a personalized prediction progress; then, it provides the recommendations for the group by aggregating group members' preferences, which mainly concerns the preferences of members who haven't seen the items. Without complex computation, the proposed algorithm can make accurate predictions of each item for group members. We demonstrate our algorithm on a famous dataset called MovieLens and use the recall, the precision metrics and a combination of them to evaluate its performance. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can provide high quality group recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

In general, MoodPic was found to be a successful concept and stated to add novel experiences to music listening. Accessing music through mood pictures was highly appreciated and seen as a good way to discover new music over the genre boundaries and receive music recommendations from real users based on their mood picture interpretation. Sorting music based on mood pictures instead of genres was seen as an interesting and easy way to interact with music. Based on the interview results, this paper introduces several ideas for further improving the music listening experience using mood pictures as a basis for play lists.

Specifically, we added Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for stream mining inside an event processing engine, called Esper. Using the system, these two algorithms were compared over LastFM social music site data and by using tumbling windows. The better-performing FPGrowth was selected and used in creation of a real-time rulebased recommendation engine. Our most important findings show that online association rule mining can generate (1) more rules, (2) much faster and more efficiently, and (3) much sooner than offline rule mining. In addition, we have found many interesting and realistic musical preference rules such as "George Harrison⇒Beatles".

abstract = {The problem of user's interest to item matching is at the core of recommendation systems and search engines. This problem is well studied in different contexts such as item, document, music and movie recommendations. For the purpose of recommendation these systems store the context or the meta-data information about the item of interest (e.g. user rating for books, tags, price etc). However, the general approaches for finding relevant items for recommendation cannot be directly applied in the case when the context or meta-data information about the item of interest is missing. In this paper we describe an algorithmic approach to handle this problem of missing context for items. In the proposed approach we have extended the context of user's interest and developed an unsupervised algorithm to find the items of interest for the user. Finally the items are ranked based on their relevance to the user's interest. We study this problem in the domain of dataset recommendation where the meta-data information about the datasets is missing due to lack of coherent and complete repository for the research datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with real world dataset consisting of 20 user queries. We find that the proposed framework can recommend datasets for user queries with a recall of 90% in the top-4 recommendations. We also compared the performance of the dataset finding algorithm with the state of art supervised classification approach. We get a significant improvement of 36% using the proposed algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The similarity information not only captures the similar patterns from the referred objects, but enhances the convergence speed and accuracy of FM. In addition, in order to avoid the noise within large similarity of features, we also adopt the grouping FM as an extended method to model the problem. In our experiments, a music-recommendation dataset is used to assess the performance of the proposed approach. The datasets is collected from an online blogging website, which includes user listening history, user profiles, social information, and music information. Our experimental results show that, with various types of feature similarities the performance of music recommendation can be enhanced significantly. Furthermore, via the grouping technique, the performance can be improved significantly in terms of Mean Average Precision, compared to the traditional collaborative filtering approach. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Typically, they work by analyzing the past user-song relationships, and provide informed guesses based on the overall information collected from other users. Although the music listening behavior is a repetitive and time-dependent process, these methods have not taken this into account and only consider user-song interaction for recommendation. In this work, we explore the usage of temporal context and session diversity in Session-based Collaborative Filtering techniques for music recommendation. We compared two techniques to capture the users' listening patterns over time: one explicitly extracts temporal properties and session diversity, to group and compare the similarity of sessions, the other uses a generative topic modeling algorithm, which is able to implicitly model temporal patterns. We evaluated the developed algorithms by measuring the Hit Ratio, and the Mean Reciprocal Rank. Results reveal that the inclusion of temporal information, either explicitly or implicitly, increases significantly the accuracy of the recommendation, while compared to the traditional session-based CF. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Web sites and online services now typically contain millions of music tracks, which complicate search, retrieval and discovery of music. Music recommender systems can address these issues by recommending relevant and novel music to a user based on personal musical tastes. A typical scenario in music recommendation is that the music consumption is focused on some popular tracks and the most unpopular tracks are rarely accessed (i.e., the Long Tail problem). In this paper, we evaluate the impact of using context-aware recommender systems to recommend music in the Long Tail. We perform a set of experiments by applying three different context-aware recommender systems on three different real world data sets. Our findings show that by using contextual information we can improve music recommendation in the Long Tail scenario. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The above requires ability to classify web videos into a set of categories appropriate for the personalization application.

In order to clearly distinguish between friends sharing the same interest, especially since Last.fm recommends friends based on similarity of taste, we separated the timeless effect of similar taste from the temporal impulses of immediately listening to the same artist after a friend. We measured strong increase of listening to a completely new artist in a few hours period after a friend compared to non-friends representing a simple trend or external influence. In our experiment to eliminate network independent elements of taste, we improved collaborative filtering and trend based methods by blending with simple time aware recommendations based on the influence of friends.

Our method employs multiple seed artists as an input that are obtained via the Facebook likes of artists and the listening history of songs of a Spotify user. First, we construct an input vector comprising all the artists that the user likes on Facebook and listens to in Spotify. Then, we search for other artists and bands related to them using EchoNest, an online state-of-the-art machine learning platform. We assign a score to every artist in the thereby obtained collection, based on the frequency of his/her appearance. Finally, we construct a playlist comprising randomly selected popular songs associated with the most frequently cited artists. We examine the recommendation performance of our algorithm by computing its WTF score (fraction of disliked songs) and novelty factor (fraction of new liked songs) on playlists generated for different seed input sizes. We observe that our approach substantially outperforms the built-in Spotify Radio recommender. On 30 song playlists, we are able to improve the WTF score by 49% and the novelty factor by 42%, on average.

abstract = {Recently, many mobile techniques such as sensor networks or various types of mobile devices make it possible to provide smart services at any time, and anywhere. In despite of these remarkable advances of techniques, there are few personalized mobile recommendation services which fully consider user's current situation. Proposed recommendation algorithm efficiently defines user's current situation with situational data captured from various smartphone sensors. Also, the algorithm uses user's social network for efficiently filtering valuable items which are considered as authorities. To verify the usefulness of proposed technique, we implement a prototype of the personalized music recommendation service in which proposed recommendation technique is applied. Additionally, through the demonstration of implemented prototype, we investigate the effect of incorporating smartphone sensor data and social data to collaborative filtering algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {We present an automated approach to music search and playlist generation based on fractal dimensions of music. We compute 372 power-law metrics per song capturing statistical proportions of musical material. Using attribute selection and principal component analysis, we have reduced these metrics to approximately 45 independent features. These have been shown to capture important aspects of music aesthetics and similarity. Through an audio-to-MIDI transcription process, users may upload MP3 songs as search queries, in real time. This new development enables construction of music recommendation systems, which may work with previously unknown music. Unlike Pandora, last.fm, and Genius, such systems will analyze the actual music (potentially like the human ear), as opposed to harvesting information from humans (e.g., websites, user preferences, or musicologist recommendations). This approach combines time-frequency and spectral processing, information retrieval and audio analysis, and music classification. We present two on-line demos, using corpora from Magnatune and 7digital. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Mobile devices more often than not provide incomparably more relevant information and context about their users than was ever available on desktops or within classic web browsing.

In this paper we describe our novel method for learning users' situation preferences to suggest the right moments for performing specific actions independently. Such action can be for example autonomous news push in a news application, but it can be just as easily applied to songs or microblog recommenders. User preferences are described with situations the users encounter throughout the time and rules that are based on either implicit or explicit feedback from the users. The focus of this paper is on the action suggestion method for the right moment for performing an action alongside which we also introduce a few usage scenarios, discuss on characteristics and limits of our method and present experiments that evaluate on our method's performance in various scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {A health social network is an online information service which facilitates information sharing between closely related members of a community with the same or a similar health condition. Over the years, many automated recommender systems have been developed for social networking in order to help users find their communities of interest. For health social networking, the ideal source of information for measuring similarities of patients is the medical information of the patients. However, it is not desirable that such sensitive and private information be shared over the Internet. This is also true for many other security sensitive domains. A new information-sharing scheme is developed where each patient is represented as a small number of (possibly disjoint) d-words (discriminant words) and the d-words are used to measure similarities between patients without revealing sensitive personal information. The d-words are simple words like food, and thus do not contain identifiable personal information. This makes our method an effective one-way hashing of patient assessments for a similarity measure. The d-words can be easily shared on the Internet to find peers who might have similar health conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Consequently, the design of personalized user interfaces and music recommender systems might benefit from understanding the relationship between personality and use of social media. Since there has not been a study between personality and use of Twitter at large, we set out to analyze the relationship between personality and different types of Twitter users, including popular users and influcntials. For 335 users, we gather personality data, analyze it, and find that both popular users and influentials are extroverts and emotionally stable (low in the trait of Neuroticism). Interestingly, we also find that popular users are'imaginative'(high in Openness), while influentials tend to be'organized'(high in Conscientiousness). We then show a way of accurately predicting a user's personality simply based on three counts publicly available on profiles: following, followers, and listed counts. Knowing these three quantities about an active user, one can predict the user's five personality traits with a root- mean-squared error below 0.88 on a [1,5] scale. Based on these promising results, we argue that being able to predict user personality goes well beyond our initial goal of informing the design of new personalized applications as it, for example, expands current studies on privacy in social media. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents an extensive analysis of a sample of a social network of musicians. The network sample is first analyzed using standard complex network techniques to verify that it has similar properties to other web-derived complex networks. Content-based pairwise dissimilarity values between the musical data associated with the network sample are computed, and the relationship between those content-based distances and distances from network theory explored. Following this exploration, hybrid graphs and distance measures are constructed, and used to examine the community structure of the artist network. Finally, results of these investigations are shown to be mostly orthogonal between these distance spaces. These results are considered with a focus recommendation and discovery applications employing these hybrid measures as their basis. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for music recommendation. Firstly, we describe an approach for creating music recommendations based on user-supplied tags that are augmented with a hierarchical structure extracted for top level genres from Dbpedia. In this structure, each genre is represented by its stylistic origins, typical instruments, derivative forms, sub genres and fusion genres. We use this well-organized structure in dimensionality reduction in user and item profiling. We compare two recommenders; one using our method and the other using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) in dimensionality reduction. The recommender using our approach outperforms the other. In addition to different dimensionality reduction methods, we evaluate the recommenders with different user profiling methods. Moreover, our approach collects personal interests (favorite movies and television series) from the Facebook profiles. These user profiles are then used to find the similarity between users. At the end, items belonging to the most similar users' profiles and having a high score against users' profiles are recommended. Thus, we have focused on a hybrid system using tag-based contextual information of music tracks and user interests acquired from Facebook profiles. Initial results are promising such that using similarities of users affects the recommendation positively. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been gaining popularity and appreciation over the past few years and they kept growing towards a semantic web. Internet users search for more and more facilities to get information and recommendations based on their preferences, experience and expectations. Nowadays, there are many recommender systems on the web for music, movies, diets, products, etc. Some of them use very efficient recommending techniques (ex. Amazon), while others are very simple, based on algorithms that do not always provide relevant or interesting recommendations. The solution we propose is a recommender system for running professionals and amateurs, which is able to provide information to users regarding the workout and the diet that best suits them, based on their profile information, preferences and declared purpose. The solution mixes a social dimension derived from an expanding community with expert knowledge defined within an ontology. Moreover, our model addresses adaptability in terms of personal profile, professional results and unfortunate events that might occur during workouts. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Social Tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize items (songs, pictures, Web links, products, etc.). Social tagging systems (STSs) can provide three different types of recommendations: They can recommend 1) tags to users, based on what tags other users have used for the same items, 2) items to users, based on tags they have in common with other similar users, and 3) users with common social interest, based on common tags on similar items. However, users may have different interests for an item, and items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items, and tags. These data are modeled by a 3-order tensor, on which multiway latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using both the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) method and the Kernel-SVD smoothing technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

@article{nanopoulos2010musicbox,
abstract = {Social tagging is becoming increasingly popular in music information retrieval (MIR). It allows users to tag music items like songs, albums, or artists. Social tags are valuable to MIR, because they comprise a multifaced source of information about genre, style, mood, users' opinion, or instrumentation. In this paper, we examine the problem of personalized music recommendation based on social tags. We propose the modeling of social tagging data with three-order tensors, which capture cubic (three-way) correlations between users-tags-music items. The discovery of latent structure in this model is performed with the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), which helps to provide accurate and personalized recommendations, i.e., adapted to the particular users' preferences. To address the sparsity that incurs in social tagging data and further improve the quality of recommendation, we propose to enhance the model with a tag-propagation scheme that uses similarity values computed between the music items based on audio features. As a result, the proposed model effectively combines both information about social tags and audio features. The performance of the proposed method is examined experimentally with real data from Last.fm. Our results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to existing methods that suppress the cubic relationships that are inherent in social tagging data. Additionally, our results suggest that the combination of social tagging data with audio features is preferable than the sole use of the former. {\textcopyright} 2009, IEEE},

In this paper, we investigate a method that uses information exploited from a user's online media sharing activities as a novel source of implicit feedback for recommendation system. We look into elements of media sharing behavior and suggest whether behaviors have the potentiality that could play a role as a predictor of users' preference. Then in a specific domain, we choose appropriate behaviors by two criteria: abundance and observability. As a representative case, we focus on YouTube, one of the most popular social video sharing sites. By criteria we suggest, we select three behaviors including favorite, upload and view and formulate the simple item-based algorithm based on those behaviors. Through a series of experiments, we evaluate recommendation results obtained from our dataset by comparison with those from other reference algorithms. The results show that favorite and upload have possibility to be used as implicit feedback. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Social network studies are becoming increasingly popular and have been applied to several fields of study such as law enforcement, marketing, spread of disease, as well as in the improvement of organizational performance. One area that is yet to be explored relates to harnessing the power of social networks as recommender systems. The idea that users may provide other users with recommendations that are more relevant than naive approaches is long known. However, the approaches currently implemented are based on the creation of simple relationships such as co-purchase of similar items. Similarly, video websites would like to suggest related videos to users to maximize the time they spend on their sites. Ergo it is crucial that sites like YouTube provide users with recommendations that are relevant to them. Moreover, given the large amount of videos on YouTube, a good recommender system may alleviate users' efforts on finding videos that interest them the most. Existing recommender systems for YouTube are typically based on finding similarities between the videos' textual features (video title or tags annotations) and matching these features to tags in the user's profiles or the videos they are currently watching. This approach is very limited because it restricts the users interests to the current theme of the video being played or the preferences in their profiles. This means that if one is watching a movie about football, it is assumed that the user would like recommendations on other videos about football. In this paper, we attempt to extract information about video relationship using a network formed from reviews left as comments in YouTube videos. We create a network of videos called YouTube Recommender Network (YRN) and use complex network analysis on this network as the basis of a recommender system. Our results show that our list of recommended videos is more diverse than the ones based on textual information. Our YRN provides diversity and captures other important characteristics such as high rating and most-viewed count. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

The recommender system, which is able to timely select data of the interest to each individual user, has become the key to any successful business. However, currently most recommendation systems are based on a centralized architecture; nonetheless, they are not suitable for P2P environments. In this article, we propose a distributed semantic P2P overlay, which can provide music search and recommendation services by considering both of user preference and diversity of interests. We then propose a 3C hybrid recommendation procedure that adapts three traditional filtering techniques to fitting the requirements in a distributed semantic overlay. First, we choose a set of proper meta-data to represent a music object and use them to construct the characteristic-vector-based content filter. Second, a dominant attribute, which is one of the attributes in the characteristic vector of a music object, is used to build the profile of a peer. With the idea of the social network, a P2P profile-based collaborative filter is proposed. Finally, we explore the item-to-item relationship to construct a history-based cooperative filter. We use simulations and a real database called AudioScrobbler, which tracks users' listening habits, to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with existing recommendation systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},
