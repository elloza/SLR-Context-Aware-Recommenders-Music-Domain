For instance, choosing which movie to watch is a simple, small-sized decision-making process. Recommender systems help people to make this kind of choices, usually by computing a short list of suggestions that reduces the space of possible options. These systems are strongly based on the knowledge of user preferences but, in order to fully support people, they should be grounded on a holistic view of the user behavior, that includes also how emotions, mood, and personality traits influence her choosing patterns. In this work, we investigate how to include emotional aspects in the recommendation process. We suggest that the affective state of the user, defined by a set of emotions (e.g., joy, surprise), constitutes part of choosing situation that should be taken into account when modeling user preferences. The main contribution of the paper is a general emotion-aware computational model based on affective user profiles in which each preference, such as a 5-star rating on a movie, is associated with the affective state felt by the user at the time when that preference was collected. The model estimates whether an unseen item is suitable for the current affective state of the user, by computing an affective coherence score that takes into account both the affective user profile and not-affective item features. The approach has been implemented into an Emotion-aware Music Recommender System, whose effectiveness has been assessed by performing in-vitro experiments on two benchmark datasets. The main outcome is that our system showed improved accuracy of recommendations compared to baselines which include no affective information in the recommendation model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Affective Computing; Decision Making; Emotions; Music Recommendation; myPersonality; Recommender Systems","Behavioral research; Decision making; Benchmark datasets; Cognitive process; Coherence models; Computational model; Decision making process; Emotional aspect; Music recommender systems; Personality traits; Recommender systems",,,,,"Regione Puglia","The research has been partially funded by the Apulia Region, Italy, POR Puglia FESR-FSE Innonetwork, project DECiSION: DATA-DRIVEN CUSTOMER SERVICE INNOVATION.",,"(2011), pp. 217-253. , Adomavicius, Gediminas and Alexander Tuzhilin. ”Context-aware recommender systems”.

We have two motivations to extend the existing systems: (1) to the best of our knowledge, the current systems first estimate the user’s emotions and then suggest music based on it. Therefore, the emotion estimation error affects the recommendation accuracy. (2) Studies show that the pattern of users’ interactions with input devices can reflect their emotions. However, these patterns have not been used yet in emotion-aware music recommender systems. In this study, a music recommender system is proposed to suggest music based on users’ keystrokes and mouse clicks patterns. Unlike the previous ones, the proposed system maps these patterns directly to the user’s favorite music, without labeling its current emotion. The results show that even though this system does not use any additional device, it is highly accurate compared to previous methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Collaborative filtering; Emotion-aware music recommender; Keystroke pattern; Mouse click pattern","Mammals; Emotion estimation; Existing systems; Highly accurate; Input devices; Mouse clicks; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Recommendation accuracy; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Abdul, A., Chen, J., Liao, H.-Y., Chang, S.-H., An emotion-aware personalized music recommendation system using a convolutional neural networks approach (2018) Appl Sci, 8, p. 1103; Aljanaki, A., Wiering, F., Veltkamp, R.C., Studying emotion induced by music through a crowdsourcing game (2016) Inform Process Manag, 52 (1), pp. 115-128; Aracena, C., Basterrech, S., Snáel, V., Velásquez, J., Neural networks for emotion recognition based on eye tracking data (2015) Paper Presented at the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Systems, , Man, and Cybernetics; Ayata, D., Yaslan, Y., Kamasak, M.E., Emotion based music recommendation system using wearable physiological sensors (2018) IEEE Trans Consumer Electron, 64 (2), pp. 196-203; Burns, H., Burns, S., (2015) Moving Averages 101: Incredible Signals that Will Make You Money in the Stock Market, , CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; Burns, S., Burns, H., (2017) 5 Moving Average Signals that Beat Buy and Hold: Backtested Stock Market Signals, , CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; Deng, S., Wang, D., Li, X., Xu, G., Exploring user emotion in microblogs for music recommendation (2015) Expert Syst Appl, 42 (23), pp. 9284-9293; Estrada, J., Buhia, J., Guevarra, A., Forcado, M.R., Keyboard and mouse: Tools in identifying emotions during computer activities (2017) Paper Presented at the International Conference on Big Data Technologies and Applications; Gavrilescu, M., Recognizing emotions from videos by studying facial expressions, body postures and hand gestures (2015) Paper Presented at the 2015 23Rd Telecommunications Forum Telfor (TELFOR); Geng, B., Li, L., Jiao, L., Gong, M., Cai, Q., Wu, Y., NNIA-RS: A multi-objective optimization based recommender system (2015) Physica A: Statistic Mech Appl, 424, pp. 383-397; Goldberg, D., Nichols, D., Oki, B.M., Terry, D., Using collaborative filtering to weave an information tapestry (1992) Commun ACM, 35, pp. 61-70; Gu, Y.H., Yoo, S.J., Piao, Z., No, J., Jiang, Z., Yin, H., A smart-device news recommendation technology based on the user click behavior (2016) Paper Presented at the Sixth International Conference on Emerging Databases: Technologies, Applications, and Theory; Hamedani, E.M., Kaedi, M., Recommending the long tail items through personalized diversification (2019) Knowledge-Based Syst, 164, pp. 348-357; Hu, X., Bai, K., Cheng, J., (2017); Jannach, D., Zanker, M., Felfernig, A., Friedrich, G., Recommender systems, an introduction (2011) Hardback (November, p. 2010; Kabani, H., Khan, S., Khan, O., Tadvi, S., Emotion based music player (2015) Int J Eng Res Gen Sci, 3 (1), pp. 2091-2730; Kawakami, A., Furukawa, K., Katahira, K., Kamiyama, K., Okanoya, K., Relations between musical structures and perceived and felt emotions (2012) Music Perception: Interdisciplin J, 30 (4), pp. 407-417; Kawakami, A., Furukawa, K., Katahira, K., Okanoya, K., Sad music induces pleasant emotion (2013) Frontiers Psychol, 4, p. 311; Khan, I.A., Brinkman, W.P., Hierons, R., Towards estimating computer users’ mood from interaction behaviour with keyboard and mouse (2013) Front Comput Sci, 7 (6), pp. 943-954; Khanna, P., Sasikumar, M., Recognising emotions from keyboard stroke pattern (2010) Int J Comput Appl, 11 (9), pp. 1-5; KM, A., Kiran, B., Shreyas, B., Victor, S.J., A multimodal approach to detect user's emotion (2015) Procedia Comput Sci, 70, pp. 296-303; Lukose, S., Upadhya, S.S., (2017) Music Player Based on Emotion Recognition of Voice Signals.

To select which music to recommend, traditional RS uses an approximation of users’ real interests. However, while discarding users’ contexts, profiles information is not able to reflect their exact needs and to provide overpowering recommendations. One of the main issues that have to be considered before the conception of context-aware recommender systems (CARS) is the estimation of the relevance of contextual information. The use of irrelevant or superfluous contextual factors can generate serious problems about the complexity and the quality of recommendations. In this paper, we introduce a multi-dimensional context model for music CARS. We started by the acquisition of explicit items rating from a population in various possible contextual situations. Thus, we proposed a user-based methodology aiming to judge the relation between contextual factors and musical genres. Next, we applied the Multiple Linear Regression technique on users’ perceived ratings, to define an order of importance between contextual dimensions. We described raw collected data with basic statistics about the created dataset. We also summarized the key results and discussed key findings. Finally, we propose a new framework for Music CARS. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Context model; Multiple Linear Regression; Music recommendation; Recommender systems; User-based study","Coherent scattering; Linear regression; Recommender systems; Context-aware recommender systems; Contextual dimensions; Contextual factors; Contextual information; Multi dimensional; Multiple linear regressions; Music preferences; Quality of recommendations; Information use",,,,,,,,"Adams, A., Cox, A.L., Questionnaires, in-depth interviews and focus groups (2008) Research Methods for Human Computer Interaction, pp. 17-34. , Cairns P, Cox AL, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Adomavicius, G., Jannach, D., Preface to the special issue on context-aware recommender systems (2014) User Model.

This article focuses on a personalized music recommender system that incorporates rich content and context data in a unified and adaptive way to address the abovementioned problems. The content information includes music textual content, such as metadata, tags, and lyrics, and the context data incorporate users' behaviors, including music listening records, music playing sequences, and sessions. Specifically, a heterogeneous information network (HIN) is first presented to incorporate different kinds of content and context data. Then, a novel method called content- and context-aware music embedding (CAME) is proposed to obtain the low-dimension dense real-valued feature representations (embeddings) of music pieces from HIN. Especially, one music piece generally highlights different aspects when interacting with various neighbors, and it should have different representations separately. CAME seamlessly combines deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms, with the embedding model to capture the intrinsic features of music pieces as well as their dynamic relevance and interactions adaptively. Finally, we further infer users' general musical preferences as well as their contextual preferences for music and propose a content- and context-aware music recommendation method. Comprehensive experiments as well as quantitative and qualitative evaluations have been performed on real-world music data sets, and the results show that the proposed recommendation approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is able to handle sparse data effectively. © 2012 IEEE.","Attention; content; context-aware; embedding; recommender systems","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Embeddings; Information services; Attention mechanisms; Content information; Feature representation; Heterogeneous information; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Qualitative evaluations; Recommendation methods; Learning systems; article; attention; convolutional neural network; deep learning; embedding; human; human experiment; music; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis",,,,,"GK199900299012-017

This has opened up a research area, namely the identification of biases introduced by recommender systems in the music context. Recent research, which focused on users of the Last.fm platform found that state-of-the-art music recommendation systems frequently tend to favor already popular items. To this end, we propose a new method for predicting music recommendations, which relies on a cluster-based quotas system. By assuming the distribution of the popularity of artists to have a latent variable that is estimated with a Gaussian Mixture, we find the underlying popularity clusters and use them to make the predictions by quotas that relate to each cluster mixing proportion, in a way that the resulting popularity distribution in the recommendations is closer to the popularity distribution seen in the data. In our experiments with the Last.fm data, our final predictions increased the recommendation frequencies of less popular artists, while preserving the specific characteristics of each algorithm. The GAP(g)r and mean average error (MAE) metrics are improved, showing that our recommendations are more accurate and approximate to the expected popularity of the artists in each user profile. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","Cluster-based; Fairness; Music recommendation systems; Popularity bias; Prediction quotas",,,,,,,,,"Abdollahpouri, H., Burke, R., Mobasher, B., Controlling popularity bias in learning-to-rank recommendation (2017) Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 42-46; Bauer, C., Schedl, M., Global and country-specific mainstreaminess measures: Definitions, analysis, and usage for improving personalized music recommendation systems (2019) PloS one, 14 (6); Cataltepe, Z., Altinel, B., Music recommendation by modeling user’s preferred perspectives of content, singer/genre and popularity (2009) Collaborative and Social Information Retrieval and Access: Techniques for Improved User Modeling, pp. 203-221. , IGI Global; Celma, Ò., Cano, P., From hits to niches?

Its main purpose is to suggest to the user the most appropriate music to improve the performance of the physical activity at recommending time. The conducted experiments along a case study prove that this system is useful and satisfactory when the activity does not require a great deal of concentration. During activities that required movement, most users indicated that the perceived effort decreases when using the recommendation system proposed. They also indicated that their mood had improved after using this system. This demonstrates the usefulness of this recommender system while doing physical activities. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Context-aware recommender systems; Emotional state; Entrainment; Music; Physical activities","Artificial intelligence; Automatic Detection; Context-aware recommender systems; Contextual information; Daily activity; Focus of Attention; Music Recommendation System; Music recommender systems; Physical activity; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Karageorghis, C.I., Priest, D.L., Music in the exercise domain: a review and synthesis (Part I) (2012) Int.

Context and content features are used as auxiliary information to compensate for implicit feedback. The recent development of communication technology and portable electronic devices has changed the way of consuming music. We can access a vast amount of music items via online music streaming services. As a result, finding appropriate music items from enormous resources gets to be difficult for users. To help users discover their favorite music items, recommender systems in the music domain have been studied. This paper focuses on two challenges specific to music recommender systems: the difficulty of obtaining explicit feedback such as ratings, and the importance of making use of context information. To handle the context information as auxiliary information to compensate for implicit feedback, this paper employs FMs (Factorization Machines), in which the context information is treated as features. Utilizing the merit of FMs that can easily introduce features, this paper also introduces content features in addition to context features. As it is known that using low-level content features directly is not effective because of the semantic gap, this paper proposes two types of abstract content features: UGP (user genre profile) and UCP (user content profile). The effectiveness of the proposed method and the effect of negative sampling methods are evaluated in terms of MPR with #nowplaying-rs and LFM-1b dataset. The result of the experiment shows that the proposed method outperforms wALS (weighted Alternating Least Squares), which is one of the popular music recommendation algorithms based on matrix factorization. The characteristics of the proposed sampling methods are investigated with different settings of the parameters and the ratio of negative samples. As for the effectiveness of each feature, it is found that a feature is effective when JS (Jensen-Shannon) divergence of popularity distribution among different feature values is large. It is also shown that the UCP and UGP cluster labels are more effective than using content features directly. © 2021, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

In the field of music information retrieval and recommendation, emotion is considered contextual information that is hard to capture, albeit highly influential. In this study, we analyze the connection between users' emotional states and their musical choices. Particularly, we perform a large-scale study based on two data sets containing 560,000 and 90,000 #nowplaying tweets, respectively. We extract affective contextual information from hashtags contained in these tweets by applying an unsupervised sentiment dictionary approach. Subsequently, we utilize a state-of-The-Art network embedding method to learn latent feature representations of users, tracks and hashtags. Based on both the affective information and the latent features, a set of eight ranking methods is proposed. We find that relying on a ranking approach that incorporates the latent representations of users and tracks allows for capturing a user's general musical preferences well (regardless of used hashtags or affective information). However, for capturing context-specific preferences (a more complex and personal ranking task), we find that ranking strategies that rely on affective information and that leverage hashtags as context information outperform the other ranking strategies. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Emotion in music; emotion regulation; hashtags; microblogging; music recommendation; ranking; sentiment detection","Electronic mail; Electronic musical instruments; Embeddings; Job analysis; Recommender systems; Emotion in music; Emotion regulations; Hashtags; Microblogging; Music; Music recommendation; ranking; Tagging; Task analysis; Twitter; Data mining",,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST: MOST 106-3114-E-002-007","The computational results presented have been achieved (in part) using the HPC infrastructure LEO of the University of Innsbruck.

The typical approach towards this goal is to identify playlist characteristics by inspecting the existing tracks (i.e., seeds) in target playlists. However, seeds are not always available, especially when users create new playlists. For such cold-start situations, user-generated titles can be a good starting point to understand the intended purpose of users. This paper investigates the effectiveness of titles as an auxiliary data source for playlists suffering from the cold-start problem. Employing three naive recommendation models, we conduct experiments on one million music playlists from the Spotify platform. Our analyses show that the prevalent attitude in naming playlists results in highly accurate recommendations for playlists concerning a specific theme, such as albums, artists, and soundtracks. As the title space moves away from a particular theme, recommendation accuracy drops. Furthermore, the correlation between the common preference of a title and its usability in recommendation is quite weak; a title without a common sense may be useless in recommender systems, even though many users favor that title. Consequently, our findings serve as a guideline to develop title-aware recommendation approaches that can provide coherent continuations to the cold-start playlists. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Automatic playlist continuation; Cold-start problem; Music recommender systems; Playlist titles; User-generated content","Computer science; Auxiliary data; Cold start problems; Effectiveness analysis; Highly accurate; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Recommendation accuracy; User-generated; Recommender systems",,,,,,"This work was supported by the Grant 20ADP172 from Eskisehir Technical University.",,"Antenucci, S., Boglio, S., Chioso, E., Dervishaj, E., Kang, S., Scarlatti, T., Dacrema, M.F., Artist-driven layering and user’s behaviour impact on recommendations in a playlist continuation scenario (2018) Proceedings of the ACM Recommender Systems Challenge 2018, Vancouver, BC, Canada, pp. 1-4. , (,), .

The method is based on the technique of distributed representation of words. Instead of the metadata, such as genres and artists, the proposed approach takes the listening environment into consideration. By using the listening environment, it is possible to recommend music lyrics that fit the atmosphere of a touristspot when the user enjoys the sightseeing. In this paper, the proposed method recommends the lyrics that fits the atmosphere of a tourist-spot by sharing the distributed representation beyond the domains of lyrics and reviews. The method uses a corpus of lyrics to build the distributed representation model, and both lyrics' and reviews' vectors are calculated with the model. As a result, the tourist-spot reviews are assumed to be types of lyrics. Based on the lyric-like vector representation of reviews, the similarity between reviews and lyrics can be calculated. The experiment showed a positive result to the recommendation made by the proposed method. © 2020 IEEE.","context aware music recommendation; cross domain retrieval; lyrics; music information retrieval","Distributed representation; Music retrieval; Tourist spots; Vector representations; Word vectors; Artificial intelligence",,,,,,,,"Cheng, Z., Shen, J., On effective location-Aware music recommendation (2016) Acm Trans.

Many users listen to music for multiple mood regulation purposes. Therefore, emotional preference should be taken into consideration especially when building context-aware music recommendation systems which aim to satisfy users’ short-term music needs. In addition, cultural differences will affect the way people experience and value emotion from music. Based on these aspects, we investigate the emotional preference of music in daily activities through a cross-cultural survey in China and the UK, and build emotional maps between activity and music for the two countries. Furthermore, we introduce EmoMusic, a novel emotion-based music recommendation service for daily activities which supports visualisation and control of music emotion through an interactive interface. A user study is presented to evaluate the application. Results reveal good usability of the service and show that visualization and interaction in a music emotion space can improve acceptance of music recommendations. Our work helps to understand the emotional preference of music for various activities and how to exploit emotional cues of music in a music recommendation service, paving the way for more user-centered music recommendation systems. © 2020 IEEE","Cross-cultural; Emotional preference; User-centered music recommendation","Binary alloys; Intelligent computing; Potassium alloys; Recommender systems; Visualization; Context-Aware; Cultural difference; Daily activity; Interactive interfaces; Mood regulations; Music emotions; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Uranium alloys",,,,,"2019C03137

However, we know little about how to recommend songs that are motivational for people given their contexts and activities. As a first step towards dealing with this issue, we adopt a theory-driven approach and operationalize the Brunel Music Rating Inventory (BMRI) to identify motivational qualities of music from the audio signal. When we look at frequently listened songs for 14 common daily activities through the lens of motivational music qualities, we find that they are clustered into three high-level latent activity groups: calm, vibrant, and intense. We show that our BMRI features can accurately classify songs in the three classes, thus enabling tools to select and recommend activity-specific songs from existing music libraries without any input required from user. We present the results of a preliminary user evaluation of our song recommender (called PepMusic) and discuss the implications for recommending songs for daily activities. © 2020, The Author(s).","Daily activities; Motivational qualities; Music; Music recommendation","Daily activity; Enabling tools; Music library; Music quality; Sports performance; Theory driven approaches; Through the lens; User evaluations; Audio acoustics",,,,,,"We thank all the participants who participated in the user study.

Among the most common activities performed when listening to music is relaxation. According to findings from the area of music therapy, a good musical choice for relaxation needs personalization. However, until now, many studies in the area of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) have focused on only identifying general characteristics of music according to certain contexts. Thus, this paper focuses on expanding the findings of music therapy, considering aspects of musicology and a large amount of data. To this end, we: (i) explore more than 60 thousand handcrafted playlists of almost 5 thousand users; (ii) create a user preference model based on high and low-level features of the songs and (iii) analyze the differences between the users' preferences. The results of our analysis suggest that personalization plays a key role in the playlists created by the users. With this work, we want to pave the way and encourage the improvement of context-aware music recommender systems or other MIR concepts like user behavior analysis. © 2020 ACM.","Context-aware Recommender Systems; Personalization; Relaxing Music","Occupational therapy; Recommender systems; Large amounts; Low-level features; Music information retrieval; Music recommender systems; Personalizations; Specific activity; User behavior analysis; User preference modeling; Behavioral research",,,,,,,,"Burns, D.S., Sledge, R.B., Fuller, L.A., Daggy, J.K., Monahan, P.O., Cancer patients’ interest and preferences for music therapy (2005) Journal of Music Therapy, 42 (3), pp. 185-199. , 2005; Clark, M., Isaacks-Downton, G., Wells, N., Redlin-Frazier, S., Eck, C., Hepworth, J.T., Chakravarthy, B., Use of preferred music to reduce emotional distress and symptom activity during radiation therapy (2006) Journal of Music Therapy, 43 (3), pp. 247-265. , 2006; Davis, W.B., Thaut, M.H., The influence of preferred relaxing music on measures of state anxiety, relaxation, and physiological responses (1989) Journal of Music Therapy, 26 (4), pp. 168-187. , 1989; Hargreaves, D.J., North, A.C., The functions of music in everyday life: Redefining the social in music psychology (1999) Psychology of Music, 27 (1), pp. 71-83. , 1999; Hartigan, J.A., Wong, M.A., Algorithm AS 136: A k-means clustering algorithm (1979) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

However, the musical domain presents distinctive challenges to recommender systems: tracks are short, listened to multiple times, typically consumed in sessions with other tracks, and relevance is highly context-dependent. In this paper, we argue that modeling users' preferences at the beginning of a session is a practical and effective way to address these challenges. Using a dataset from Spotify, a popular music streaming service, we observe that a) consumption from the recent past and b) session-level contextual variables (such as the time of the day or the type of device used) are indeed predictive of the tracks a user will stream - much more so than static, average preferences. Driven by these findings, we propose CoSeRNN, a neural network architecture that models users' preferences as a sequence of embeddings, one for each session. CoSeRNN predicts, at the beginning of a session, a preference vector, based on past consumption history and current context. This preference vector can then be used in downstream tasks to generate contextually relevant just-in-time recommendations efficiently, by using approximate nearest-neighbour search algorithms. We evaluate CoSeRNN on session and track ranking tasks, and find that it outperforms the current state of the art by upwards of 10% on different ranking metrics. Dissecting the performance of our approach, we find that sequential and contextual information are both crucial. © 2020 ACM.","Context; Music Recommendation; Sequence; User Embeddings","Embeddings; Nearest neighbor search; Network architecture; Recommender systems; Context dependent; Contextual information; Contextual variables; Music recommendation; Musical domains; Nearest-neighbour search algorithms; Popular music; State of the art; Online systems",,,,,,,,"Anderson, A., Kumar, R., Tomkins, A., Vassilvitskii, S., The dynamics of repeat consumption (2014) International Conference on World Wide Web.

A large number of existing digital music libraries have improved awareness among people through the music recommendation approach. However, several critical technical challenges still require attention and must be well–addressed to provide a reliable recommendation to music listeners. In Indian Classical Music, Raga is composed of coalescing diverse musical note structures. The history of classical music unveils that every raga possesses some distinct sessions. With a vast collection of classical music files in online music libraries, locating and listening to classical music is no more a difficult task. However, searching and listening to the audio of one’s preference may not be simple as it must instinctively satisfy the listener’s preference in a precise session. In this paper, a system termed as iMusic has been proposed to classify, analyze, and recommend the session–sensitive performance of Indian classical music by analyzing the musical note structures followed by features matching. Available note-patterns in the raga performance have been illustrated using a deep neural network and a set of machine learning algorithms where raga samples have been represented as inputs in the projected network and are classified based on the performing sessions. A context-aware k-means clustering algorithm has also been illustrated, entitled as a data filtering algorithm. The proficiency of the filtering algorithm has been established in two ways. Primarily, as a data-sensitive analysis, and second as empirical studies on synthetically obtained real classical music dataset (https://github.com/SamarjitRoy89/iMusic.git) to put on the hybrid music recommendation. In this work, a case-study of session-sensitive Indian music recommender system has been demonstrated using key-strategies viz. listener modelling, representation learning, and music profiling. Eventually, several evaluation metrics have been discussed to characterize the effectiveness of proposed representation learning-based playing session-sensitive music recommendation strategies. The proposed iMusic system renders data classification accuracy of ~ 88%. Such a framework could provide a useful basis regarding studies on hybrid music recommendation systems based on the usefulness of end-users. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Classical music; Clustering; Computational musicology; Deep neural network; Hybrid collaborative filtering; Internet of music things; Music recommendation; Representation learning","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Digital libraries; Flocculation; K-means clustering; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Libraries; Recommender systems; Signal filtering and prediction; Data classification; Digital music libraries; Filtering algorithm; Indian classical music; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Music recommender systems; Technical challenges; Computer music",,,,,"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी

Social networks enclose valuable data regarding user behavior and connections that can be exploited in this area to infer knowledge about user preferences and social influence. The fact that streaming music platforms have some social functionalities also allows this type of information to be used for music recommendation. In this work, we take advantage of the friendship structure to address a type of recommendation bias derived from the way collaborative filtering methods compute the neighborhood. These methods restrict the rating predictions for a user to the items that have been rated by their nearest neighbors while leaving out other items that might be of his/her interest. This problem is different from the popularity bias caused by the power-law distribution of the item rating frequency (long-tail), well-known in the music domain, although both shortcomings can be related. Our proposal is based on extending and diversifying the neighborhood by capturing trust and homophily effects between users through social structure metrics. The results show an increase in potentially recommendable items while reducing recommendation error rates. © 2020 by the authors.","Collaborative filtering; Homophily; Music recommender systems; Social influence; Social trust; Streaming services","Behavioral research; Recommender systems; Collaborative filtering methods; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Nearest neighbors; Power law distribution; Recent researches; Social information; Social structure; Collaborative filtering",,,,,"Junta de Castilla y León: SA064G19","Funding: This research was funded by Junta de Castilla y León, Spain, grant number SA064G19.",,"Aggarwal, C.C., (2016) Recommender Systems;, , Springer: New York, NY, USA; Pérez-Marcos, J., Martín-Gómez, L., Jimenez-Bravo, D.M., López, V.F., Moreno-García, M.N., Hybrid system for video game recommendation based on implicit ratings and social networks (2020) J.

The majority of these services are endowed with recommendation mechanisms that help users to discover songs and artists that may interest them from the vast amount of music available. However, many are not reliable as they may not take into account contextual aspects or the ever-evolving user behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to develop systems that consider these aspects. In the field of music, time is one of the most important factors influencing user preferences and managing its effects, and is the motivation behind the work presented in this paper. Here, the temporal information regarding when songs are played is examined. The purpose is to model both the evolution of user preferences in the form of evolving implicit ratings and user listening behavior. In the collaborative filtering method proposed in this work, daily listening habits are captured in order to characterize users and provide them with more reliable recommendations. The results of the validation prove that this approach outperforms other methods in generating both context-aware and context-free recommendations. © 2020 by the authors.","CARS; Collaborative filtering; Implicit ratings; TARS; Time-aware music recommender systems",,,,,,"Consejería de Educación, Junta de Castilla y León: SA064G19","This research was funded by the Junta de Castilla y Le?n, Spain, grant number: SA064G19.",,"Iqbal, M., Spotify Usage and Revenue Statistics.

Recent studies have shown that humans respond as well as react to music in a very positive manner and that music has a high impact on human's brain activity. Nowadays, people often prefer to listen to music based on their moods and interests. This work focuses on a system that suggests songs to the users, based on their state of mind. In this system, computer vision components are used to determine the user's emotion through facial expressions and chatbot interactions. Once the emotion is recognized, the system suggests a song for that emotion, saving a lot of time for a user over selecting and playing songs manually. © 2020 IEEE.","CNN; Emotion recognition; Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC); Facial expression; Semantic analysis","Brain activity; Chatbot; Facial Expressions; High impact; Music recommender systems; Vision components; Brain",,,,,,,,"Andelin, E.I., Rusu, A.S., (2015) Investigation of Facial Micro-expressions of Emotions in Psychopathy-a Case Study of An Individual in Detention, , Published by Elsevier Ltd; Ekman, P., Friesen, W.V., Ellsworth, P., (2013) Emotion in the Human Face: Guidelines for Research and An Integration of Findings, , Elsevier; De La Torre, F., Cohn, J.F., Facial expression analysis (2011) Vis.

These intelligent systems succeed in learning the user's profile to recommend movies, music, news and more. However, for designing context-aware recommendations, new challenges emerge in predicting the situational needs of the user. We prototyped Ambient Wanderer, our personalised and contextualised Point-of-Interest (POI) recommender system and experimented it with new locals, people who have recently relocated to a city. Our key findings include: sudden breakdowns during urban exploration, trust issues with the recommendations from people unlike them, feeling bored as the trigger to POI search, intent to find free activities, information needs on areas-of-interest beyond points-of-interest and the demand to build a new social life. For each of these needs, we present the implications to design mobile recommendations for urban exploration. © 2020 ACM.","Context-aware; Personalised; Poi recommender; Prototyping; Wizard of oz","Intelligent systems; Context-aware recommendations; Mobile recommendations; Point of interest; Points of interest; Social life; User's profiles; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Amershi, S., Cakmak, M., Bradley Knox, W., Kulesza, T., Power to the people: The role of humans in interactive machine learning (2014) AI Magazine, 35 (4), p. 105. , https://doi.org/10.1609/aimag.v35i4.2513; Amer-Yahia, S., Borromeo, R.M., Elbassuoni, S., Omidvar-Tehrani, B., Viswanathan, S., Interactive generation and customization of travel packages for individuals and groups (2020) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces Companion (IUI '20)., pp. 69-70. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3379336.3381456, Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA; Amin, A., Townsend, S., Van Ossenbruggen, J., Hardman, L., Fancy a drink in canary wharf?: A user study on location-based mobile search (2009) Human-Computer Interaction -INTERACT 2009, pp. 736-749. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-03655-2-80, Tom Gross, Jan Gulliksen, Paula Kotzé, Lars Oestreicher, Philippe Palanque, Raquel Oliveira Prates and Marco Winckler (eds.).

Meanwhile, manifold personal factors of users are also important for the problem, and research efforts have been made to improve the recommendation performance with auxiliary user information. As an important indicator of users' personal traits and states, the numerous social media content (e.g., texts, images and short videos), however, is still hardly exploited. In this work, we systematically study the utilization of multimodal social media content for music recommendation. We define groups of both targeted handcrafted features and generic deep features for each modality, and further propose an Attentive Multimodal Autoencoder approach (AMAE) to learn cross-modal latent representations from the extracted features. Attention mechanism is also employed to integrate users' global and contextual music preference with alterable weights. Experiments demonstrate remarkable improvement of recommendation performance (+2.40% in Hit Ratio and +3.30% in NDCG), manifesting the effectiveness of our AMAE approach, as well as the significance of incorporating social media content data in music recommendation. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Learning systems; Social networking (online); Attention mechanisms; Auto encoders; Music preferences; Music recommendation; Personal traits; Recommendation performance; Research efforts; User information; Neural networks",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61521002, 61831022

In this work, we study the relationship between user context and audio content in order to enable context-aware music recommendation agnostic to user data. For that, we propose a semi-automatic procedure to collect track sets which leverages playlist titles as a proxy for context labelling. Using this, we create and release a dataset of ~50k tracks labelled with 15 different contexts. Then, we present benchmark classification results on the created dataset using an audio auto-tagging model. As the training and evaluation of these models are impacted by missing negative labels due to incomplete annotations, we propose a sample-level weighted cross entropy loss to account for the confidence in missing labels and show improved context prediction results. © 2020 IEEE.","dataset collection; missing labels; multi-label classification; music auto-tagging; user context","Audio signal processing; Classification (of information); Speech communication; Audio content; Benchmark classification; Context predictions; Context-Aware; Cross entropy; Music recommendation; Semi-automatic procedures; Tagging models; Audio acoustics",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020

This paper provides a reflective review of the research literature in the field that is categorized in three contexts: education, mental health, and community. Grouping knowledge in this way affords a new perspective on how music therapists describe adolescents, including the terms we use to describe them, the types of programs we offer, the approaches to research that are most popular, and the way we talk about the focus of therapy. Distinctions between research in these fields are highlighted, with reference to the beliefs and values that are most congruent with each of these contexts. Following this reflective review on the literature, I provide five recommendations for consideration by researchers and practitioners. These include: determining if and when evidence is an appropriate focus; continuing to seek understanding; not underestimating the value of positive experiences; avoiding an exclusive focus on the music therapist's perspective; and being realistic about the outcomes of group versus individual therapy. The paper concludes with an illustrative example to emphasize how one adolescent might be ""seen"" differently in each context. © 2019 American Music Therapy Association 2019.

Representation strategies play a very important role in these systems, as an adequate codification of users and items is expected to ease the induction of a model which synthesizes their tastes and make better recommendations. However, in addition to gathering information about users’ tastes, there is an additional aspect that can be relevant for a proper codification strategy, namely the order in which the user interacted with the items. In this paper, several encoding strategies based on neural networks are analyzed and applied to solve two different recommendation tasks in the context of music playlists. The results show that the order in which the musical pieces were listened to is relevant for the codification of items (songs). We also find that the encoding of user profiles should use a different amount of historical data depending on the learning task to be solved. In other words, we do not always have to use all the available data; sometimes, it is better to discard old information, as tastes change over time. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Collaborative filtering; Matrix factorization; Profiles; Recommender systems","Collaborative filtering; Encoding (symbols); Factorization; Recommender systems; Encoding strategy; Historical data; Learning tasks; Matrix factorizations; Musical pieces; Profiles; User profile; Signal encoding",,,,,"Nvidia","We are grateful to NVIDIA Corporation for the donation of the Titan Xp GPU used in this research.",,"Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.S., Zheng, X., (2016) Tensorflow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems; Caruana, R., Lawrence, S., Giles, C.L., Overfitting in neural nets: Backpropagation, conjugate gradient, and early stopping (2001) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 13, pp. 402-408. , Leen, T.K., Dietterich, T.G., Tresp, V., MIT Press; Celma, O., (2010) Music Recommendation and Discovery in the Long Tail, , Springer, Berlin; Chan, N.N., Gaaloul, W., Tata, S., A recommender system based on historical usage data for web service discovery (2012) Serv.

Conventional music recommendation systems are, however, in general based on the simple user–track relationships or the content of songs and recommend songs according to intrinsic factors. Furthermore they do not consider the users’ contextual factors towards providing them with a more interpretable, efficient and smart recommendation experience. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Information Network-based Music Recommendation System (HIN-MRS). By considering the extrinsic factors, such as contextual factors, internal factors, such as the user's personalized preference, and the heterogeneous relationship between items of song information, this method can perceive the user's music selection from multiple aspects, automatically maintain the user's playlist and improve the user's music experience. First we used the obtained textual data to extract the user's music preference to provide the topic which is usually related to the contextual factors, by means of which an HIN-MRS can realize the perception of the mobile environment. Second, after determining the topics, we built a small-scale HIN of songs (song HIN) according to topics and used a graph-based algorithm to generate recommendations. The recommendation method based on an HIN renders the recommendation process more efficient and the recommendation results more accurate and increases the users satisfaction. The results of our final experiments also prove the significant advantages of the proposed model over the conventional approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Heterogeneous information networks; Mobile networks; Music recommendation","Graphic methods; Information services; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless networks; Contextual factors; Conventional approach; Graph-based algorithms; Heterogeneous information; Mobile environments; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Recommendation methods; Recommender systems",,,,,"Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, ZUEL: 201911424, 2722019JCT037

While such platforms provide access to millions of songs, the sheer volume of choices available renders it hard for users to find songs they like. Consequently, the task of finding music the user likes is often mitigated by music recommender systems, which aim to provide recommendations that match the user’s current context. Particularly in the field of music recommendation, adapting recommendations to the user’s current context is critical as, throughout the day, users listen to different music in numerous different contexts and situations. Therefore, we propose a multi-context-aware user model and track recommender system that jointly exploit information about the current situation and musical preferences of users. Our proposed system clusters users based on their situational context features and similarly, clusters music tracks based on their content features. By conducting a series of offline experiments, we show that by relying on Factorization Machines for the computation of recommendations, the proposed multi-context-aware user model successfully leverages interaction effects between user listening histories, situational, and track content information, substantially outperforming a set of baseline recommender systems. © 2020, The Author(s).","Context-aware recommender systems; Personalization; Recommender systems; User modeling",,,,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Context-aware recommender systems (2010) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 217-253. , Ricci F., Rokach L., Shapira B., Kantor P.

This paper proposes a method for recommending music items considering listeners’ context information. Recently, users can enjoy music easily regardless of time and a place due to evolution of online music services such as Spotify. However, it is difficult for us to find appropriate music items from enormous resources. On the other hand, because of listening style and characteristic of music items, music items do not usually have explicit rating. Therefore, implicit feedback such as playing count has been widely used to construct recommender systems. As additional information, this paper considers listeners’ context. The proposed method employs FMs (Factorization Machines), in which the context information is treated as factors. Negative sampling is applied to reduce the number of negative samples (music items a user has yet to be listened). The effectiveness of the proposed method and the effect of negative sampling are evaluated with an offline experiment. The experimental result on nowplaying-rs dataset shows that the proposed method outperforms wALS (weighted Alternating Least Squares) method. Furthermore, different negative sampling methods such as popularity-based one and sampling with different time window size are also investigated. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Context-aware recommendation; Factorization Machines; Music recommendation; Negative sampling","Artificial intelligence; Factorization; Recommender systems; Alternating least squares; Context information; Context-aware recommendations; Different time windows; Factorization machines; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Online music services; Least squares approximations",,,,,,,,"Resnick, P., Iacovou, N., Suchak, M., Bergstrom, P., Riedl, J., An open architecture for collaborative filtering of netnews (1994) ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, pp. 175-186; Aggarwal, C.C., (2016) Recommender Systems, pp. 1-28. , Springer, Heidelberg; Oard, D.W., Kim, J., Implicit feedback for recommender systems (1998) In: AAAI Workshop on Recommender Systems, 83, pp. 81-83; Hu, Y., Koren, Y., Volinsky, C., Collaborative filtering for implicit feedback datasets (2008) 8Th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, pp. 263-272; Pan, R., Zhou, Y., Cao, B., Liu, N.N., Lukose, R., Scholz, M., Yang, Q., One-class collaborative filtering (2008) 8Th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, pp. 502-511; Zhang, W., Chen, T., Wang, J., Yu, Y., Optimizing top-N collaborative filtering via dynamic negative item sampling (2013) 36Th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 785-788; Rendle, S., Freudenthaler, C., Gantner, Z., Schmidt-Thieme, L., BPR: Bayesian personalized ranking from implicit feedback (2009) 25Th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 452-461; Rendle, S., Factorization machines with libFM (2012) ACM Trans.

Considering millions of songs available in online streaming services, it is difficult to identify the most suitable song for an emotion of a user. Most of the music recommendation systems available today, are based on user ratings and acoustic features of the songs. Those systems are unable to address the cold start problem and rating diversity. Furthermore, song preferences will be altering based on the current mood of the users. If these problems were not addressed, then these online services will fail to achieve user satisfaction. To cope with those problems, this paper proposes a novel music recommendation approach that utilizes social media content such as posts, comments, interactions, etc. and recommend them with the most relevant songs to relax their mind considering the current mood (happy, sad, calm and angry). The current mood and the preferences are extracted from the social media profile of the users. Then the songs were classified to moods based on the lyrics and audio of the songs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Music recommendation; Personalized recommendation; Social media","Human computer interaction; Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Acoustic features; Cold start problems; Context-Aware; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; On-line service; Streaming service; User satisfaction; User experience",,,,,"University of Moratuwa","This research was supported by the Faculty of Information Technology, University of Moratuwa and the Senate Research Committee, University of Moratuwa.",,"Kim, J.-Y., Belkin, N.J., Categories of music description and search terms and phrases used by non-music experts (2002) Proceedings of the 3rd International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2002), pp. 209-214; Juslin, P.N., Laukka, P., Expression, perception, and induction of musical emotions: a review and a questionnaire study of everyday listening (2004) J.

Therefore, making the right choice of music for this purpose is fundamental. In the area of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), many works try to classify, in a general way, songs that are better suited to certain activities/contexts, but there is a lack of works that seek first to answer if personalization is an essential criterion for the selection of songs in this context. Thus, in order to investigate whether personalization plays a vital role in this context, more specifically in relaxation, we: (i) analyze more than 60 thousand playlists created by more than 5 thousand users from the 8tracks platform; (ii) extract high and low-level features from the songs of these playlists; (iii) create a user perception based on these features; (iv) identify users groups by their perceptions; (v) analyze the contrasts between these groups, comparing their most relevant features. Our results help to understand how personalization is essential in the context of relaxing music, paving the way for more informed MIR systems. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Context-aware music recommendation; Music features; Personalization; Relaxing music","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Leisure activities; Low-level features; Music features; Music information retrieval; Music recommendation; Personalizations; Psychological state; Relaxing music; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Yadati, K., Liem, C.C.S., Larson, M., Hanjalic, A., On the automatic identification of music for common activities (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval, ICMR 2017, pp. 192-200. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3078971.3078997, Bucharest, Romania, 6–9 June 2017; Rentfrow, P.J., Gosling, S.D., The do re mi’s of everyday life: The structure and personality correlates of music preferences (2003) J.

Robotic musicianship has evolved from isolated novelty to a growing field of research with audience-inspiring outcomes (Hoffman and Weinberg in Auton Robot 31(2–3):133–153, [1]). Between 2002 and 2017 the number of members in the International Society for Music Information Retrieval has grown from about 500 to well over 2000 (https://www.ismir.net/stats.php ). As the field of artificial intelligence for music-related tasks continues to grow, so grows the need for better, more robust learning systems that are able to more deeply understand people’s responses, preferences, and intentions to music. Such learning systems are not only valuable in the specific contexts in which understanding music, and human psychology with respect to music, is valuable, but also has broader implications regarding learning systems in general. From reasoning about implicit mental states in human counterparts and how they are affected by surrounding stimuli, to temporal adaptation to changing preferences and circumstances, to online context-aware recommendation, music serves as an excellent testbed for a wider, broader array of more general questions involving continual learning, system adaptation, and social agents. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,,,,,,,"Hoffman, G., Weinberg, G., Interactive improvisation with a robotic marimba player (2011) Auton.

It has achieved rapid development in theoretical research and practice. It selects information and similarity relationships based on the user's history and collects others that are the same as the user's hobbies. User's evaluation information is to generate recommendations. The main research is the inadequate combination of context information and the mining of new points of interest in the context-aware recommendation process. On the basis of traditional recommendation technology, in view of the characteristics of the context information in music recommendation, a personalized and personalized music based on popularity prediction is proposed. Recommended algorithm is MRAPP (Media Recommendation Algorithm based on Popularity Prediction). The algorithm first analyzes the user's contextual information under music recommendation and classifies and models the contextual information. The traditional content-based recommendation technology CB calculates the recommendation results and then, for the problem that content-based recommendation technology cannot recommend new points of interest for users, introduces the concept of popularity. First, we use the memory and forget function to reduce the score and then consider user attributes and product attributes to calculate similarity; secondly, we use logistic regression to train feature weights; finally, appropriate weights are used to combine user-based and item-based collaborative filtering recommendation results. Based on the above improvements, the improved collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm in this paper has greatly improved the prediction accuracy. Through theoretical proof and simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the MRAPP algorithm is demonstrated. © 2020 Hui Ning and Qian Li.",,"Forecasting; Logistic regression; Signal filtering and prediction;

In this context, the research community has identified What if? questions as an approach for users to investigate and question such recommendations - yet many current applications seem limited in practically supporting this. We present a set of example GUIs and interaction techniques currently used in everyday recommendation systems in practice (e.g. Grammarly, Apple Music, Google Maps). Based on these example cases, we discuss possible UI extensions to explicitly support What if? interactions. From our analysis and reflection emerges the general approach of treating decision variables as a “first-class citizen” in UIs: We propose to 1) represent a recommended item's decision variables in the user interface (and not just the item itself), and 2) to enable direct manipulation of these decision variables for What if? explorations.

The recent work of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of movie recommendations has shown that this popularity bias leads to unfair treatment of both long-tail items as well as users with little interest in popular items. In this paper, we reproduce the analyses of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of music recommendation. Specifically, we investigate three user groups from the Last.fm music platform that are categorized based on how much their listening preferences deviate from the most popular music among all Last.fm users in the dataset: (i) low-mainstream users, (ii) medium-mainstream users, and (iii) high-mainstream users. In line with Abdollahpouri et al., we find that state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms favor popular items also in the music domain. However, their proposed Group Average Popularity metric yields different results for Last.fm than for the movie domain, presumably due to the larger number of available items (i.e., music artists) in the Last.fm dataset we use. Finally, we compare the accuracy results of the recommendation algorithms for the three user groups and find that the low-mainstreaminess group significantly receives the worst recommendations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Algorithmic fairness; Item popularity; Music recommendation; Popularity bias; Recommender systems; Reproducibility","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Long tail; Movie recommendations; Music recommendation; Popular music; Recommendation algorithms; Reproducibilities; State of the art; User groups; Recommender systems",,,,,"825619

With the potential of digital movie and tv series industry, developing an automatic movie recommendation engine becomes a popular issue. Traditionally movie recommendation is based on structured information like director, players, rough class, etc. Recently, there are more and more researches trying to make a recommendation based on context information like music recommendation based on lyrics with the word vector representation. However, in the long text scenario, the recommendation based on all context vector makes the inference very imprecise.In this paper, we propose effective features types, relationships, and scenarios, to extract important information then improve the recommendation. Furthermore, comparing different pre-training model, we try to maximize the effectiveness of semantic understanding and make the recommendation be able to reflect meticulous perception on the relationship between social media articles and movie plot. © 2019 IEEE.","Bert; Plot summaries Analysis; Social Media Analysis; Trailer Recommendation System; Word2Vec","Artificial intelligence; Motion pictures; Semantics; Social networking (online); Bert; Movie recommendations; Music recommendation; Plot summaries Analysis; Semantic understanding; Social media analysis; Structured information; Word2Vec; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Pouransari, H., Ghili, S., (2015) Deep Learning for Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews; Sorostinean, M., Sana, K., (2017) Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews, , March 1; Arora, G., Kumar, A., (2014) Movie Recommendation System Based on Users' Similarity Ijcsmc, 3 (4), pp. 765-770. , April; Vu, X., Park, S., (2017) Mining User/Movie Preferred Features Based on Reviews for Video Recommendation System; Golbeck, J., (2006) Generating Predictive Movie Recommendations from Trust in Social Networks; Mikolov, T., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space (2013) ICLR Workshop; Yoon, K., (2014) Convolutional Neural Net-works for Sentence Classification, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1408.5882; Extended-HowNet, , http://ehownet.iis.sinica.edu.tw/index.php; Chen, K.J., Huang, S.L., Shih, Y.Y., Chen, Y.J., Extended-hownet-A representational framework for concepts (2005) Processing of OntoLex 2005-Ontologies and Lexical Resources IJCNLP-05 Workshop, , Jeju Island, South Korea; Huang, S.L., Chung, Y.S., Chen, K.J., E-hownet-An expansion of hownet (2008) Proceedings of 1st National HowNet Workshop, , Beijing, China.CKIP Group (2013 reversion), Lexical Semantic Representation and Semantic Composition-An Introduction to E-How Net, CKIP Technical Report; Zendong, D., Dong, Q., (2006) HowNet and the Computation of Meaning, , World Scientific Publishing Co.

One of the problems persists during the music listening is that common music playing application lacks the ability to acquire context of the user. Another problem that common music recommendation system fails to address the emotional impact of the recommended song. To address this gap, this paper presents a music recommendation system based on fuzzy inference engine that considers user activities and emotion as part of the recommendation parameters. The system includes building a smart music recommendation system that has user profiling capabilities to recommend correct songs based on the user’s preferences, mood and time. Findings of the this paper have shown that Heartbeats’s fuzzy inference engine has successfully achieved its aim, which is to improve users’ music listening experience by giving suitable song recommendation based on user context situation. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

I chose Paul purposively because, while a high school senior, he had participated in previous research about teacher socialization. Using Olsen’s sociocultural view of teacher identity as a lens, I examined Paul’s teacher identity including personal beliefs about teaching, how those interacted with professional learning and teacher education experiences, and how Paul made sense of himself as a teacher. Through data analysis I revealed three themes: Becoming Student Focused, Learning to Be Myself as a Teacher, and Taking Ownership. I recommend making preservice and cooperating music teachers more aware of teacher identity models and suggest activities to promote teacher identity development in music teacher education programs. Music teacher educators would benefit from having more teacher identity scholarship focused on music student teachers and beginning music educators. © National Association for Music Education 2019.","beginning teachers; case study; identity; student teaching",,,,,,,,,"Austin, J.R., Isbell, D.S., Russell, J.A., A multi-institution exploration of secondary socialization and occupational identity among undergraduate music majors (2012) Psychology of Music, 40, pp. 66-83; Ballantyne, J., Kerchner, J.K., Aróstegui, J.L., Developing music teacher identities: An international multi-site study (2012) International Journal of Music Education, 30, pp. 211-226; Ballantyne, J., Packer, J., Effectiveness of preservice music teacher education programs: Perceptions of early-career music teachers (2004) Music Education Research, 6, pp. 299-312; Beijaard, D., Meijer, P., Developing the personal and professional in making a teacher identity (2017) The Sage handbook of research on teacher education, 2, pp. 177-192. , Clandinin D.J., Husu J., (eds), London, England, Sage, (Eds.), (,., –; Beijaard, D., Meijer, P., Verloop, N., Reconsidering research on teachers’ professional identity (2004) Teaching and Teacher Education, 20, pp. 107-128; Blair, D.V., Chelsea’s journey of becoming a teacher.

Traditional recommender systems have concentrated on information or document retrieval and then were extended with methods for music or movie recommendations. SRS are useful especially in the context of online stores: User can quickly find relevant items and a company can improve its income by recommending additional items.A slightly different situation is in the case of research paper recommendation. Usually, researchers are looking for relevant papers using some search engines. Using a few keywords, one can obtain a list of similar works. Let us consider a situation when a researcher likes to find conference or journal where it is worth to publish. He or she receives many, calls for papers' but most of them are not correlated with their researcher interests. In this paper we propose a method for journal or conference recommendation based on social community of researchers. We present a method that combines content-based, collaborative and social approaches to find the best place to publish. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Recommender systems; Cold start problems; Collaborative recommendation; Document Retrieval; Generic frameworks; Movie recommendations; Scientific networks; Social communities; Social recommender systems; Search engines",,,,,"Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation","*This research was partially supported by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education.",,"Aguilar, J., Valdiviezo-Diaz, P., Riofrio, G., A general framework for intelligent recommender systems (2017) Applied Computing and Informatics, 13, pp. 147-160; Burke, R., Knowledge-based recommender systems (2000) Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science; Dhanda, M., Verma, V., Recommender system for academic literature with incremental dataset (2016) Procedia Computer Science, 89, pp. 483-491; Homann, L., Maleszka, B., Martins, D.M.L., Vossen, G., A generic framework for collaborative filtering based on social collective recommendation (2018) Proceedings of ICCCI 2018, LNAI 11055, pp. 238-247; Hsu, P.Y., Lei, H.T., Huang, S.H., Liao, T.H., Lo, Y.C.H., Lo, C.H.C.H., Effects of sentiment on recommendations in social network (2018) Electron Markets, 29 (2), pp. 253-262. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s12525-018-0314-5; Isinkaye, F.O., Folajimi, Y.O., Ojokoh, B.A., Recommendation systems: Principles, methods and evaluation (2015) Egyptian Informatics Journal, 16, pp. 261-273; Lops, P., De Gemmis, M., Semeraro, G., Content-based recommender systems: State of the art and trends (2011) Recommender Systems Handbook.

Therefore, contextual information, such as user's current activity and mood state could be used to greatly improve music recommendations. In this paper, we develop a smartphone-based mobile system that includes two core modules for recognizing human activities and then accordingly recommending music. In the proposed method, a deep residual bidirectional gated recurrent neural network is applied to obtain high activity recognition accuracy from accelerometer signals on the smartphone. In order to improve the performance of tempo-oriented music classification, an ensemble of dynamic classification using a long-term modulation spectrum and sequence classification using a short-term spectrogram is used. Music recommendation is performed using the relationship between the recognized human activities and the music files indexed by tempo-oriented music classification that reflects user preference models in order to achieve high user satisfaction. The results of comprehensive experiments on real data confirm the accuracy of the proposed activity-aware music recommendation framework. © 1975-2011 IEEE.","Accelerometer data; deep learning; human activity recognition; music classification; music recommendation","Accelerometers; Deep learning; Pattern recognition; Recurrent neural networks; Smartphones; Accelerometer data; Dynamic classification; Human activity recognition; Music classification; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Sequence classification; User preference models; Recommender systems",,,,,"Kwangwoon University, KW University

However, most recommender systems do not allow users to adapt recommendations to their current context. We therefore built ContextPlay, a context-aware music recommender that enables user control for both contextual characteristics and music preferences. By conducting a mixed-design study (N=114) with four typical scenarios of music listening, we investigate the effect of controlling contextual characteristics in a music recommender system on four aspects: perceived quality, diversity, effectiveness, and cognitive load. Compared to our baseline which only allows to specify music preferences, having additional control for context leads to higher perceived quality and does not increase cognitive load. We also find that the contexts of mood, weather, and location tend to influence user perception of the system. Moreover, we found that users are more likely to modify contexts and their profile during relaxing activities. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Context-aware recommendation; Music recommendation; User control","Recommender systems; Additional control; Context-aware recommendations; Music preferences; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Perceived quality; User control; User perceptions; Quality control",,,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Ricci, F., RecSys' 09 workshop 3: Workshop on context-aware recommender systems (CARS-2009) (2009) Proceedings of the Third ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 423-424. , ACM; Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-The-art and possible extensions (2005) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge & Data Engineering, 6, pp. 734-749. , (2005); Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Context-aware recommender systems (2011) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 217-253. , Springer; Alpert, J.I., Alpert, M.I., Music influences on mood and purchase intentions (1990) Psychology & Marketing, 7 (2), pp. 109-133. , (1990); Andjelkovic, I., Parra, D., O'Donovan, J., Moodplay: Interactive mood-based music discovery and recommendation (2016) Proc. of UMAP '16, pp. 275-279. , ACM; Bakalov, F., Meurs, M.-J., König-Ries, B., Sateli, B., Witte, R., Butler, G., Tsang, A., An approach to controlling user models and personalization effects in recommender systems (2013) Proc. of IUI'13, pp. 49-56. , ACM; Baltrunas, L., Amatriain, X., Towards time-dependant recommendation based on implicit feedback (2009) Workshop on Context-aware Recommender Systems (CARS'09), , Citeseer; Bostandjiev, S., O'Donovan, J., Höllerer, T., Taste weights: A visual interactive hybrid recommender system (2012) Proc. of RecSys'12, pp. 35-42. , ACM; Chen, Y., Pu, P., CoFeel: Using emotions for social interaction in group recommender systems (2012) First International Workshop on Recommendation Technologies for Lifestyle Change (LIFESTYLE 2012), p. 48; De Vries, P.W., (2004) Trust in Systems: Effects of Direct and Indirect Information, , Technische Universiteit Eindhoven; Dhahri, C., Matsumoto, K., Hoashi, K., Mood-aware music recommendation via adaptive song embedding (2018) 2018 IEEE/ACMInternational Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM), pp. 135-138. , IEEE; Egermann, H., Sutherland, M.E., Grewe, O., Nagel, F., Kopiez, R., Altenmüller, E., Does music listening in a social context alter experience?

Instead of capturing general user preferences, the task of next-item recommendation focuses on revealing specific session preferences encoded in the most recent user interactions. This study focuses on the music domain, particularly on the task of music playlist continuation, a paradigmatic case of next-item recommendation. While the accuracy achieved in next-song recommendations is important, in this work we shift our focus toward a deeper understanding of fundamental playlist characteristics, namely the song order, the song context and the song popularity, and their relation to the recommendation of playlist continuations. We also propose an approach to assess the quality of the recommendations that mitigates known problems of off-line experiments for music recommender systems. Our results indicate that knowing a longer song context has a positive impact on next-song recommendations. We find that the long-tailed nature of the playlist datasets makes simple and highly expressive playlist models appear to perform comparably, but further analysis reveals the advantage of using highly expressive models. Finally, our experiments suggest that the song order is not crucial to accurately predict next-song recommendations. © 2019, The Author(s).","Collaborative filtering; Music playlist continuation; Music recommender systems; Recurrent neural networks; Sequential recommendation",,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020

Online music service providers are devoted to recommend personalized music to users, so that more users can be attracted by spending more money on their music service platform. Hence, an accurate recommendation for users is one of the most important tasks for the music service companies. This paper proposes a novel recommender system for recommending music. According to the preliminary measurement, we find that the interest of users on music changes over time. Furthermore, we notice that the time interval between two consecutive listened/sung musics can reflect the temporal interests of users. Based on these findings, we propose MusicRecLSTM, which leverages the attention mechanism and a modified LSTM network to learn the embeddings of both the user and the music based on the sequential data and the temporal context. MusicRecLSTM also learns whether a user would tend to listen to a newly released music at a specific time. Evaluations over three real-world datasets show that the proposed MusicRecLSTM can provide high precision, compared to several state-of-the-art recommender systems, with at least 20% improvement on the recall and mean reciprocal metrics. © 2019 IEEE.","Deep learning; Neural network; Recommendation system","Computers; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Long short-term memory; Neural networks; Attention mechanisms; Music recommendation; Online music services; Real-world datasets; Sequential data; Service companies; Service platforms; State of the art; Recommender systems",,,,,"NGII20160124

We have been witnessing an ever-increasing amount of music data. At the same time, with the huge amount of online music data, users are facing an everyday struggle to obtain their interested music pieces. To solve this problem, music search and recommendation systems are helpful for users to find their favorite content from a huge repository of music. However, social influence, which contains rich information about similar interests between users and users’ frequent correlation actions, has been largely ignored in previous music recommender systems. In this work, we explore the effects of social influence on developing effective music recommender systems and focus on the problem of social influence aware music recommendation, which aims at recommending a list of music tracks for a target user. To exploit social influence in social influence aware music recommendation, we first construct a heterogeneous social network, propose a novel meta path-based similarity measure called WPC, and denote the framework of similarity measure in this network. As a step further, we use the topological potential approach to mine social influence in heterogeneous networks. Finally, in order to improve music recommendation by incorporating social influence, we present a factor graphic model based on social influence. Our experimental results on one real world dataset verify that our proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art music recommendation methods substantially. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Meta-Path; Music recommendation; Social influence; Topological potential","Heterogeneous networks; Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Topology; Meta-Path; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Similar Interests; Similarity measure; Social influence; State of the art; Topological potentials; Economic and social effects",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61702043

However, the key challenges in these systems are extracting dynamic context information and updating user's profile information. Recently by the popularity of IoT devices as well as the availability of the wireless network, a massive volume of data is available to gain useful insights into user profile which contains dynamic contextual information. IoT sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data, we need to understand them and use them in a context-aware computing platform. In this article, an adaptive context-aware service composition system is proposed using an IoT based social network dataset to find users' preferences, improve quality of experience, and boosts the personalization level of services. This paper proposes an 10T-based context-aware service composition to seamlessly find adaptive services offered by a service provider at anytime and anywhere. Firstly, the proposed system considers the dynamic social profile of the user and clusters their preferences while other systems take only static user interests into account. Secondly, this system increases the level of personalization by extracting context information from a user's IoT devices. Finally, the adaptive service composition provides users with various context-aware recommendation including movies, music, venues, radio stations, and events simultaneously. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed system, we target some of the smart objects such as smart watches/bands, smartphones/tablets, Google Home, and personal computers for detecting several contexts (e.g location, time, user activity, interest and e.t.c.). Experimental evaluations show that the proposed algorithm can improve accuracy and personalization of filtered items with compare to other widely-applied conventional filtering algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.","Adaptive Services; Context Awareness; Internet of Things; Sensors; Smart Objects; User Profile","Information services; Intelligent systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Personal computers; Quality of service; Radio stations; Semantics; Sensors; User interfaces; Adaptive context aware service; Adaptive services; Context- awareness; Context-aware recommendations; Internet of Things (IOT); Quality of experience (QoE); Smart objects; User profile; Internet of things",,,,,,,,"(2018) Internet of Things (IoT) Connected Devices Installed Base Worldwide From 2015 To 2025 (In Billions), , Statista; García, C.G., Meana-Llorián, D., Lovelle, J.M.C., A review about smart objects, sensors, and actuators (2017) International Journal of Interactive Multimedia & Artificial Intelligence, 4 (3); Bhatt, Y., Bhatt, C., (2017) Internet Of Things In Healthcare, In Internet Of Things and Big Data Technologies For Next Generation Healthcare, pp. 13-33. , Springer; Wu, W., Improving performance of tensor-based context-Aware recommenders using bias tensor factorization with context feature auto-encoding (2017) Knowledge-Based Systems, 128, pp. 71-77; Zheng, Y., (2018) Context-Aware Mobile Recommendation By A Novel Post-Filtering Approach; Ishanka, P., Yukawa, T., Yukawa, T., An analysis of emotion and user behavior for context-Aware recommendation systems using prefiltering and tensor factorization techniques (2018) Global Journal of Computer Science and Technology; Campana, M.G., Delmastro, F., Recommender systems for online and mobile social networks: A survey (2017) Online Social Networks and Media, 3, pp. 75-97; Sohail, S.S., Siddiqui, J., Ali, R., Classifications of recommender systems: A review (2017) Journal of Engineering Science & Technology Review, 10 (4); Colombo-Mendoza, L.O., Recommetz: A context-Aware knowledge-based mobile recommender system for movie showtimes (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, 42 (3), pp. 1202-1222; (2018) Facebook, , https://www.facebook.com, [cited 2018 August]; (2018) Gmail API, , https://developers.google.com/gmail/api, [cited 2018 August]; (2018) Foursuare, , https://foursquare.com, August, 2018; Ramirez-Garcia, X., García-Valdez, M., Post-filtering for a restaurant context-Aware recommender system (2014) Recent Advances on Hybrid Approaches for Designing Intelligent Systems, pp. 695-707. , Springer; Saeedi, S., Moussa, A., El-Sheimy, N., Context-Aware personal navigation using embedded sensor fusion in smartphones (2014) Sensors, 14 (4), pp. 5742-5767; Ekstrand, M.D., (2011) Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems, 4 (2), pp. 81-173; (2018), https://www.imdb.com, IMDb.

Temporal information has been recognized and demonstrated as useful factor in improving the quality of recommendations. However, it is under investigated in the area of music recommendations. In this paper, we propose to integrate time dynamics and implicit feedback in the music recommender systems. More specifically, we develop a time-aware recommendation approach in which we produce simulated ratings by aggregating implicit feedback with time dynamics.

The context-aware recommendation has turned out to be well-established technique, which recommends a music based on the mindset of the user in various contexts. To enhance the potential of music recommendation, the emotion and time interval are considered as the most important context. Emotion context is not explored due to the difficulty in acquisition of emotions from user’s microblogs on the particular music. This paper proposes an algorithm to extract the emotions of a user from microblog during a different time interval and represented at different granularity levels. Each music piece crawled from online YouTube repository is represented in a triplet format: (User_id, Emotion_vector, Music_id). These triplet associations are considered for developing several emotion-aware techniques to provide music recommendations. Several trial of experimentation demonstrates that the proposed method with user emotional context enhances the recommendation performance in terms of hit rate, precision, recall, and F1-measure. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Collaborative filtering;

However, recent work has unveiled the importance of other aspects of the recommendation process, including explanation, transparency, control and user experience in general. Building on these aspects, this paper introduces MoodPlay, an interactive music-artists recommender system which integrates content and mood-based filtering in a novel interface. We show how MoodPlay allows the user to explore a music collection by musical mood dimensions, building upon GEMS, a music-specific model of affect, rather than the traditional Circumplex model. We describe system architecture, algorithms, interface and interactions followed by use-case and offline evaluations of the system, providing evidence of the benefits of our model based on similarities between the typical moods found in an artist's music, for contextual music recommendation. Finally, we present results of a user study (N = 279) in which four versions of the interface are evaluated with varying degrees of visualization and interaction. Results show that our proposed visualization of items and mood information improves user acceptance and understanding of both the underlying data and the recommendations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the role of mood in music recommendation, considering both artists’ mood and users’ self-reported mood in the user study. Our results and discussion highlight the impact of visual and interactive features in music recommendation, as well as associated human-cognitive limitations. This research also aims to inform the design of future interactive recommendation systems. © 2018","Affective computing; Context-aware recommendation; Mood context; Music recommendation; Recommendation interface; Recommender systems","Data visualization; Visualization; Affective Computing; Cognitive limitations; Context-aware recommendations; Interactive features; Mood context; Music recommendation; Offline evaluation; System architectures; Recommender systems",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

People enjoy music every day and share or express their emotions through music. Therefore, finding and recommending a favorite song among many kinds of songs is important and difficult at the same time. As the online music platform became popular and many people began to use music recommendations. Many approaches have been proposed to understand the user’s music preferences and various factors have been used. Also, various recommendation methodologies have been used, such as content-based (CB) or collaborative filtering (CF). In this work, we propose a recommender system using user’s preference that was defined based on the feature extracted from the context information of the song’s lyrics. We extract and use the latent-topic in the context of the song lyrics. Our results show that it is efficient to recommend songs based on the preferred singers by analyzing user preferences. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Artist recommendation; Context awareness; Music recommendation; Recommender systems","Collaborative filtering; Data mining; Recommender systems; User interfaces; Artist recommendation; Content-based; Context information; Context- awareness; Music preferences; Music recommendation; Online music; Big data",,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP

The traditional music recommendation strategy captured users’ music preference by analyzing their historical behaviors to conduct personalized recommendation. However, users’ current states, such as in busy working or in a leisure travel, etc., have an important influence on their music enjoyment. Usually, those existing methods only focus on pushing their favorite music to users, which may be not the most suitable for current scenarios. Users’ current states should be taken into account to make more perfect music recommendation. Considering the above problem, this paper proposes a music recommendation method by considering both users’ current states and their historical behaviors. First, a feature selection process based on ReliefF method is applied to discover the optimal features for the following recommendation. Second, we construct different feature groups according to the feature weights and introduce Naive Bayes model and Adaboost algorithm to train these feature groups, which will output a base classifier for each feature group. Finally, a majority voting strategy decides the optimal music type and each user will be recommended more suitable music based on their current context. The experiments on the real datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Feature selection; Music recommendation; User context","Adaptive boosting; Bayesian networks; AdaBoost algorithm; Music recommendation; Naive Bayes models; Personalized recommendation; Personalized service; Smart applications; User context; Voting strategies; Feature extraction",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61462017, 61662015, 61862013, U1501252, U1711263

In this paper, we aim to better understand the factors that affect people's decisions as to whether they choose to listen to music recommendations and how the recommendations impact their music-listening behaviors. We conducted an online survey asking about people's past experiences on giving and receiving music recommendations. We found that in addition to the aesthetic qualities of music and the respondent's taste, expectations regarding the delivery (e.g., timing, persistence) of the recommendations, familiarity, trust in the recommender's abilities, and the rationale for suggestions were important factors. We discuss the implications for the design of music recommenders based on the findings, including better rationale for and accessibility of recommended music, improved saving options, and more targeted delivery at specific times. The data also suggests disparities in how people wish to receive music recommendations and what will influence them to listen to recommendations, versus how they would like to offer recommendations to others. In addition, the findings highlight the importance of music recommendations in people's existing social relationships and their role in building/improving new relationships. © 2020 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.

In this paper, we propose a novel music playlist recommendation problem, namely Personalized Music Playlist Recommendation (PMPR), which aims to provide a suitable playlist for a user by taking into account her long/short-term preferences and music contextual data. We propose a data-driven framework, which is comprised of two phases: user/music feature extraction and music playlist recommendation. In the first phase, we adopt a matrix factorization technique to obtain long-term features of users and songs, and utilize the Paragraph Vector (PV) approach, an advanced natural language processing technique, to capture music context features, which are the basis of the subsequent music playlist recommendation. In the second phase, we design two Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (AB-LSTM) models, i.e., typical AB-LSTM model and Improved AB-LSTM (IAB-LSTM) model, to achieve the suitable personalized playlist recommendation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using a real-world dataset, verifying the practicability of our proposed methods. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Brain; Database systems; Factorization; Natural language processing systems; Context features; Data driven; Matrix factorizations; Music streaming; NAtural language processing; Real-world; Second phase; User experience; Long short-term memory",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61532018, 61729202, 61832017, 61836007, 61872235, U1636210

Music can have a positive influence on runners' motivation and performance, but it requires selecting the most suitable song at each moment. Most of the music recommendation systems combine users' preferences and context-aware factors to predict the next song. In this paper, we include runners' emotions as part of these decisions. This fact has forced us to emotionally annotate the songs available in the system, to monitor runners' emotional state and to interpret these data in the recommendation algorithms. A new next-song recommendation system and a mobile application able to play the recommended music from the Spotify streaming service have been developed. The solution combines artificial intelligence techniques with Web service ecosystems, providing an innovative emotion-based approach.

There are many proposals in the literature that take advantage of that information and use it in the context of recommender systems. However, in the specific application domain of music the studies are much more limited, and the methods developed for other domains cannot be often applied since they require social interaction data that are not available in the streaming systems. In this paper, we present a method to determine social influence of users uniquely from friendship relations. The degree of influence obtained is used to define new similarity metrics for collaborative filtering (CF) where more weight is given to more influential users. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Collaborative filtering; Music recommender systems; Social influence; Streaming services; Trust","Artificial intelligence; Distributed computer systems; Economic and social effects; Recommender systems; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Similarity measure; Similarity metrics; Social influence; Social interactions; Streaming service; Trust; Collaborative filtering",,,,,,,,"Akcora, C.G., Carminati, B., Ferrari, E., User similarities on social networks (2013) Soc.

Due to geographical, socio-economic, linguistic, and cultural factors as well as friendship networks, users in different countries may have different music preferences. Investigating cultural-socio-economic factors that might be associated with between-country differences in music preferences can facilitate music information retrieval, contribute to the prediction of users’ music preferences, and improve music recommendation in cross-country contexts. However, previous literature provides limited empirical evidence of the relationships between possible cross-country differences on a wide range of socio-economic aspects and those in music preferences. To bridge this research gap, and drawing on a large-scale dataset, LFM-1b, this study examines the possible relationship between cross-country differences in artist, album, and genre listening frequencies as well as the cross-country distance in geographical, socio-economic, linguistic, cultural, and friendship connections using the Quadratic Assignment Procedure. Results indicate: (1) there is no significant relationship between geographical and economic distance on album, artist, and genre preferences’ distance at the country-level; (2) the cross-country distance of three cultural dimensions (masculinity, long-term orientation, and indulgence) is positively associated with both the album and artist preferences distances; (3) the between-country distance in main languages has a positive relationship with the album, artist, and genre preferences distances across countries; (4) the density of friendship connections among countries negatively correlates to the cross-country preference distances in terms of artist and genre. Findings from this study not only expand knowledge of factors related to music preferences at the country level, but also can be integrated into real-world music recommendation systems that consider country-level music preferences. © 2018 Liu et al.

Nowadays users have access to millions of songs available online. Selecting favorite music among these large archives is one of the biggest problem. Every user has his own taste of music selection. Selecting music depends on the surroundings and the mood of the user. New users and new items emerge every day, and the system has to react to them promptly. The problem of personalized music recommendation that takes different kinds of auxiliary information into consideration is resource constraint due to large amount of data involvement but these models provide much accurate results so more of these are being used for commercial purpose. The main aim of the recommendation system is to recommend songs such that it is closed to the user's choice. As a comparative study, we will be analyzing the Graph-based Novelty Research On The Music Recommendation, Music Recommendation System Based on the Continuous Combination of Contextual Information, Smart-DJ: Context-aware Personalizing for Music Recommendation on Smart phones. These models are outlined to assist the users to find out the new music that is personalized. For the analysis purpose, we will be using data set provided by Douban Music. © 2018 IEEE.","Context-awareness; Incremental Regression Tree; Music Recommendation System; Novelty; Preference-directed Graph","Directed graphs; Graphic methods; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Trees (mathematics); Context- awareness; Incremental regressions; Music Recommendation System; Novelty; Preference directed graph; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Lu, S., Tian, R., Zhang, Y., A weighted least squares support vector machine based on covariance matrix (2015) 2015 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition (ICWAPR), pp. 192-197. , Guangzhou; Dolatkia, I., Azimzadeh, F., Music recommendation system based on the continuous combination of contextual information (2016) 2016 Second International Conference on Web Research (ICWR), pp. 108-114. , Tehran; Schafer, J.B., Frankowski, D., Herlocker, J., Sen, S., (2007) Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems, p. 291324. , The adaptive web, Springer; Pazzani, M.J., Billsus, D., (2007) Content-based Recommendation Systems, p. 325341. , The adaptive web, Springer; Rho, S., Han, B.-J., Hwang, E., Svr-based music mood classification and context-based music recommendation (2009) Proceedings of the 17th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, p. 713716. , ACM; Castelluccio, M., The music genome project (2006) Strategic Finance, 88 (6), p. 57; Nanopoulos, A., Rafailidis, D., Symeonidis, P., Manolopoulos, Y., Musicbox: Personalized music recommendation based on cubic analysis of social tags, audio, speech, and language processing (2010) IEEE Transactions on, 18 (2), p. 407412; Mao, K., Chen, G., Hu, Y., (2015) Music Recommendation Using Graph Based Quality Model[J], , Signal Processing; Pazzani, M., Billsus, D., Learnin g and revising user profiles: The identification of interesting web sites[J] (1997) Machine Learning, 27 (3), pp. 313-331; Zhang, Z.-K., Liu, C., Zhang, Y.-C., Solving the coldstart problem in recommender systems with social tags[J] (2010) Europhysics Letters, 92 (2), pp. 28002-28007; Lheureux, A., Grolinger, K., Elyamany, H.F., Capretz, M.A.M., Machine learning with big data: Challenges and approaches (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 7776-7797; Jiang, C., He, Y., Smart-DJ: Context-aware personalization for music recommendation on smartphones (2016) 2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS), pp. 133-140. , Wuhan; Jin, L., Yuan, D., Zhang, H., Music recommendation based on embedding model with user preference and context (2017) 2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Big Data Analysis (ICBDA), pp. 688-692. , (Beijing, China; Guo, R., Zhang, C., Wu, M., Gao, Y., A graph-based novelty research on the music recommendation (2016) 2016 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI), pp. 1345-1350. , Las Vegas, NV; Sunitha, M., Adilakshmi, T., Mobile based music recommendation system (2016) 2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT), pp. 1-4. , Coimbatore",,"Gupta S.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2018 IEEE International Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science, SCEECS 2018","24 February 2018 through 25 February 2018",,143067,,9781538626634,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Due to the size of the collections provided, music recommender systems have become a vital component as these aim to provide recommendations that match the user's current context as, throughout the day, users listen to music in numerous different contexts and situations. In this paper, we propose a multi-context-aware track recommender system that jointly exploits information about the current situation and musical preferences of users. To jointly model users by their situational and musical preferences, we cluster users based on their situational features and similarly, cluster music tracks based on their content features. Our experiments show that by relying on Factorization Machines for the computation of recommendations, the proposed approach allows to successfully leverage interaction effects between listening histories, situational and track content information, substantially outperforming a set of baseline recommenders. © 2018 IEEE.","Context-aware Recommender Systems; Music Recommender Systems","Indexing (of information); Content information; Context-aware recommender systems; Factorization machines; Feature combination; Interaction effect; Listening history; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Lee, J.H., Kim, Y.-S., Hubbles, C., A look at the cloud from both sides now: An analysis of cloud music service usage (2016) Proc. 17th Intl.

Our method builds autonomously a latent factor model from the available online data of many users (generic song map per mood) based on the associations extracted between user, song, user mood and song emotion. It uses a combination of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework and Page-Hinkley (PH) test to personalize the general song map for each mood according to user implicit reward. We conduct a series of tests using LiveJournal two-million (LJ2M) dataset to show the effect of mood in music recommendation and how the proposed solution can improve the performance of music recommendation over time compared to other conventional solutions in terms of hit rate and Fl score. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Reinforcement learning; Hit rate; Implicit feedback; Latent factor models; Music recommendation; Online data; Page-Hinkley; Prior knowledge; Statistical tests",,,,,,,,"Andjelkovic, I., Parra, D., O'Donovan, J., Moodplay: Interactive mood-based music discovery and recommendation (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on User Modeling Adaptation and Personalization, UMAP '16, pp. 275-279. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Wang, D., Deng, S., Xu, G., Gemrec: A graph-based emotion-aware music recommendation approach (2016) Web Information Systems Engineering - WISE 2016 - 17th International Conference, pp. 92-106. , Shanghai, China, November 8-10, 2016, Proceedings, Part I; Forsati, R., Barjasteh, I., Ross, D., Esfahanian, A., Learning the implicit perference of users for effective recommendation (2017) International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM'17); Liebman, E., Saar-Tsechansky, M., Stone, P., Dj-mc: A reinforcement-learning agent for music playlist recommendation (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, AAMAS '15, pp. 591-599. , Richland, SC,.

Being able to predict this value directly benefits the recommendation and ad pacing contexts in music and video streaming services. Recent research has shown that predicting the exact amount of time spent is highly nontrivial due to many external factors for which a user can end a session, and the lack of predictive covariates. Most of the other related literature on duration based user engagement has focused on dwell time for websites, for search and display ads, mainly for post-click satisfaction prediction or ad ranking. In this work we present a novel framework inspired by hierarchical Bayesian modeling to predict, at the moment of login, the amount of time a user will spend in the streaming service. The time spent by a user on a platform depends upon user-specific latent variables which are learned via hierarchical shrinkage. Our framework enjoys theoretical guarantees and naturally incorporates flexible parametric/nonparametric models on the covariates, including models robust to outliers. Our proposal is found to outperform state-of-the-art estimators in terms of efficiency and predictive performance on real world public and private datasets. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Bayesian Modeling; Session Length; Shrinkage; User Engagement","Bayesian networks; Forecasting; Human computer interaction; Knowledge management; Shrinkage; Bayesian model; Hierarchical Bayesian modeling; Parametric/nonparametric models; Predictive performance; Session Length; Theoretical guarantees; User engagement; Video streaming services; Media streaming",,,,,,,,"Barbieri, N., Silvestri, F., Lalmas, M., Improving post-click user engagement on native ads via survival analysis (2016) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW'16), pp. 761-770. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2883092, International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee, Republic and Canton of Geneva, Switzerland; Beck, A., Teboulle, M., A fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm for linear inverse problems (2009) SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences, 2 (1), pp. 183-202. , 2009; Borisov, A., Markov, I., De Rijke, M., Serdyukov, P., A Context-aware Time Model for Web Search (2016) Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR'16), pp. 205-214. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2911504, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Celma, O., (2010) Music Recommendation and Discovery in The Long Tail, , Springer; Chen, T., Guestrin, C., XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system (2016) Proceedings of the 22Nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'16), pp. 785-794. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939785, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Efron, B., (2012) Large-Scale Inference: Empirical Bayes Methods for Estimation, Testing, and Prediction, 1. , Cambridge University Press; Efron, B., Morris, C., Limiting the risk of Bayes and empirical Bayes estimators.

For instance, a music system's page about the artist Radio-head might recommend other similar artists such as The Flaming Lips. Often central to these recommendations is the computation of similarity between pairs of items. Prior work has explored many algorithms and features that allow for the computation of similarity scores, but little work has evaluated these approaches from a user-centric perspective. In this work, we build and evaluate six similarity scoring algorithms that span a range of activity- and content-based approaches. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using both offline metrics and a new set of more than 22,000 user-contributed evaluations. We integrate these results with a survey of more than 700 participants concerning their expectations about item similarity and related item recommendations. We find that content-based algorithms outperform ratings- and clickstream-based algorithms in terms of how well they match user expectations for similarity and recommendation quality. Our results yield a number of implications to guide the construction of related item recommendation algorithms. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Collaborative filtering; Recommender systems; Related item recommendations; Rule mining; Similarity metrics; User survey; Word2vec","Collaborative filtering; Recommender systems; Related item recommendations; Rule mining; Similarity metrics; User surveys; Word2vec; Surveys",,,,,,,,"Agarwal, D., Chen, B.-C., Elango, P., Ramakrishnan, R., Content recommendation on web portals (2013) Commun.

The proposed framework leverages the available semantic labels (in terms of tags) of music tracks to complement a highly sparse user-item interaction matrix, which effectively addresses the data sparsity issue faced by most music recommendation systems. Music tracks are more accurately represented by aggregating the latent factors derived from both the tag space and the user interaction information. The proposed framework further employs a Gaussian state-space model to capture the evolving nature of users’ preferences over time, which helps achieve time-sensitive recommendation of music. A variational approximation is developed to achieve fast inference and learning of model parameters. Experiments conducted using actual music data and comparison with state-of-the-art competitive recommendation algorithms help demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Matrix factorization; Music recommendation; Tag aware; Temporal dynamics","Factorization; Recommender systems; Semantics; State space methods; Interaction matrices; Matrix factorizations; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Recommendation algorithms; Tag aware; Temporal dynamics; Variational approximation; Matrix algebra",,,,,,,,"Alhamid, M.F., Rawashdeh, M., Dong, H., Hossain, M.A., El Saddik, A., Exploring latent preferences for context-aware personalized recommendation systems (2016) IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems, 46 (4), pp. 615-623; Bishop, C., Pattern recognition and machine learning (2006), Springer; Charlin, L., Ranganath, R., McInerney, J., Blei, D.M., Dynamic poisson factorization (2015) Proceedings of the 9th ACM conference on recommender systems, pp. 155-162. , ACM; Du, N., Wang, Y., He, N., Sun, J., Song, L., Time-sensitive recommendation from recurrent user activities (2015) Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 3492-3500; Gopalan, P., Hofman, J.M., Blei, D.M., (2013), Scalable recommendation with poisson factorization. arXiv 1311.1704; Gultekin, S., Paisley, J., A collaborative Kalman filter for time-evolving dyadic processes (2014) Data mining (ICDM), 2014 IEEE international conference on, pp. 140-149. , IEEE; Hu, Y., Koren, Y., Volinsky, C., Collaborative filtering for implicit feedback datasets (2008) Data mining, 2008. icdm’08. eighth IEEE international conference on, pp. 263-272. , IEEE; Kim, S., Choi, S.-M., Han, Y.-S., Man, K.L., Wan, K., Analyzing item features for cold-start problems in recommendation systems (2014) Intelligent information hiding and multimedia signal processing (iih-msp), 2014 tenth international conference on, pp. 167-170. , IEEE; Koren, Y., Collaborative filtering with temporal dynamics (2010) Communications of the ACM, 53 (4), pp. 89-97; Liu, Y., Liu, Y., Shen, Y., Li, K., Recommendation in a changing world: Exploiting temporal dynamics in ratings and reviews (2017) ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), 12 (1), p. 3; Ma, T., Suo, X., Zhou, J., Tang, M., Guan, D., Tian, Y., Augmenting matrix factorization technique with the combination of tags and genres (2016) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 461, pp. 101-116; Sahoo, N., Singh, P.V., Mukhopadhyay, T., A hidden Markov model for collaborative filtering (2010); Sánchez-Moreno, D., González, A.B.G., Vicente, M.D.M., Batista, V.F.L., García, M.N.M., A collaborative filtering method for music recommendation using playing coefficients for artists and users (2016) Expert Systems with Applications, 66, pp. 234-244; Schein, A.I., Saul, L.K., Ungar, L.H., A generalized linear model for principal component analysis of binary data (2003) Aistats, p. 10; Sun, J.Z., Parthasarathy, D., Varshney, K.R., Collaborative kalman filtering for dynamic matrix factorization.

However, it still needs to be studied how to obtain and utilize the contextual information. In this paper, we propose a context-aware music recommendation approach, which can recommend music pieces appropriate for users’ contextual preferences for music. In analogy to matrix factorization methods for collaborative filtering, the proposed approach does not require music pieces to be represented by features ahead, but it can learn the representations from users’ historical listening records. Specifically, the proposed approach first learns music pieces’ embeddings (feature vectors in low-dimension continuous space) from music listening records and corresponding metadata. Then it infers and models users’ global and contextual preferences for music from their listening records with the learned embeddings. Finally, it recommends appropriate music pieces according to the target user’s preferences to satisfy her/his real-time requirements. Experimental evaluations on a real-world dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, and hitrate. Especially, our approach has better performance on sparse datasets. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Context-aware recommendation; Embedding; Music recommendation; Recommender systems","Factorization; Metadata; Recommender systems; Vector spaces; Context-aware recommendations; Contextual factors; Contextual information; Embedding; Experimental evaluation; Matrix factorizations; Music recommendation; Real time requirement; Collaborative filtering",,,,,"2015C01027, 2017C01015

Generally, there are not enough preferences in multidimensional contexts or the preference matrices are sparse. To handle data sparsity problem and bring contextual effects, it is important to include valid and influential context features. To do so, this proposal first acquire most important and promising contextual information belonging to three different categories to drive data selection or data construction. Then, ratings are predicted on the selected data using two different approaches i.e. collaborative filtering on user based and item based model. Afterwards, a strategy is used to combine recommendations obtained from each category of contextual information. We performed experiments on movie recommendation and music recommendation domain. The results of our experiments show the advantages of this proposal over state-of-the-art methodologies. © 2018 IEEE.","Collaborative Filtering; Contextual Categories; Item-based; Recommendation Aggregation; Semantic","Cloud computing; Digital storage; Recommender systems; Semantics; Contextual Categories; Contextual effects; Contextual information; Data sparsity problems; Item-based; Movie recommendations; Multidimensional context; Music recommendation; Collaborative filtering",,,,,,,,"Odic, A., Tkalcic, M., Tasic, J.F., Kosir, A., Relevant context in a movie recommender system: Users opinion vs. Statistical detection (2012) Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Context-Aware Recommender Systems, ACM-Recsys, 12. , Dublin, Ireland; Krulwich, B., Lifestyle finder: Intelligent user profiling using largescale demographic data (1997) Artificial Intelligence Magazine, 18 (2), pp. 37-45; Porcel, C., Tejeda-Lorente, A., Martinez, M.A., Herrera-Viedma, E., A hybrid recommender system for the selective dissemination of research resources in a technology transfer office (2012) Information Sciences, 184 (1), pp. 1-19; Billsus, D., Pazzani, M., (2000) User Modeling for Adaptive News Access, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 10 (2-3), pp. 147-180; Kong, F., Sun, X., Ye, S., A comparison of several algorithms for collaborative filtering in startup stage (2005) IEEE Transactions on Networks, Sensing and Control, pp. 25-28; Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions (2005) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17 (6), pp. 734-749; Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Context-aware recommender systems (2011) Recommender Systems Handbook, 3, pp. 217-253. , in: F.

Finding the correlation between the user data (e.g., location, time of the day, music listening history, emotion, etc.) and the music is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware personalized music recommendation system (EPMRS) to extract the correlation between the user data and the music. To achieve this correlation, we combine the outputs of two approaches: the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) approach and the weighted feature extraction (WFE) approach. The DCNN approach is used to extract the latent features from music data (e.g., audio signals and corresponding metadata) for classification. In the WFE approach, we generate the implicit user rating for music to extract the correlation between the user data and the music data. In the WFE approach, we use the term-frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach to generate the implicit user ratings for the music. Later, the EPMRS recommends songs to the user based on calculated implicit user rating for the music. We use the million songs dataset (MSD) to train the EPMRS. For performance comparison, we take the content similarity music recommendation system (CSMRS) as well as the personalized music recommendation system based on electroencephalography feedback (PMRSE) as the baseline systems. Experimental results show that the EPMRS produces better accuracy of music recommendations than the CSMRS and the PMRSE. Moreover, we build the Android and iOS APPs to get realistic data of user experience on the EPMRS. The collected feedback from anonymous users also show that the EPMRS sufficiently reflect their preference on music. © 2018 by the authors.","Convolutional neural networks; Latent features; Machine learning; Music; User preference; Weighted feature extraction",,,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, MOST: MOST 106-2221-E-182-065","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under Contract MOST 106-2221-E-182-065.

In this paper, we therefore propose a novel approach to jointly model users by the user's musical preferences and his/her cultural background. We describe the musical preferences of users by relying on the acoustic features of the songs the users have been listening to and characterize the cultural background of users by cultural and socio-economic features that we infer from the user's country. To evaluate the impact of the proposed user model on recommendation quality, we integrate the model into a culture-aware music recommender system. We show that incorporating both acoustic information of the tracks a user has listened to as well as the cultural background of users in the form of a music-cultural user model contributes to improved recommendation performance. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Music information retrieval; Recommender systems; User modeling","Computer music; Search engines; Acoustic information; Cultural backgrounds; Integrating information; Music information retrieval; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Recommendation performance; User Modeling; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Chen, T., Guestrin, C., XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system (2016) Proc. of the 22Nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '16), pp. 785-794. , ACM, New York, NY, USA; Helliwell, J.F., Layard, R., Sachs, J., (2016) World Happiness Report, , Sustainable Development Solutions Network; Hofstede, G., Jan Hofstede, G., Minkov, M., (1991) Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind, 2. , McGraw-Hill; Pichl, M., Zangerle, E., Specht, G., Understanding playlist creation on music streaming platforms (2016) 2016 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM), pp. 475-480. , IEEE; Pichl, M., Zangerle, E., Specht, G., Schedl, M., Mining Culture-Specific Music Listening Behavior from Social Media Data; Schedl, M., The LFM-1b dataset for music retrieval and recommendation (2016) Proc. of the ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval (ICMR), pp. 103-110. , ACM, New York, NY, USA; Schedl, M., Schnitzer, D., Location-aware music artist recommendation (2014) Proc. of the 20th International Conference on MultiMedia Modeling (MMM 2014), pp. 205-213. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg","Zangerle, E.; Department of Computer Science, Austria; email: eva.zangerle@uibk.ac.at",,"ACM SIGCHI;ACM SIGWEB","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","26th ACM International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization, UMAP 2018","8 July 2018 through 11 July 2018",,137932,,9781450355896,,,"English","UMAP - Proc.

To mitigate this issue, diversity-enhanced user interfaces for recommender systems have in the past found to be effective in increasing overall user satisfaction with recommendations. However, users may have different requirements for diversity, and consequently different visualization requirements. In this paper, we evaluate two visual user interfaces, SimBub and ComBub, to present the diversity of a music recommender system from different perspectives. SimBub is a baseline bubble chart that shows music genres and popularity by color and size, respectively. In addition, ComBub visualizes selected audio features along the X and Y axis in a more advanced and complex visualization. Our goal is to investigate how individual traits such as musical sophistication (MS) and visual memory (VM) influence the satisfaction of the visualization for perceived music diversity, overall usability, and support to identify blind-spots. We hypothesize that music experts, or people with better visual memory, will perceive higher diversity in ComBub than SimBub. A within-subjects user study (N=83) is conducted to compare these two visualizations. Results of our study show that participants with high MS andVMtend to perceive significantly higher diversity from ComBub compared to SimBub. In contrast, participants with low MS perceived significantly higher diversity from SimBub than ComBub; however, no significant result is found for the participants with low VM. Our research findings show the necessity of considering individual traits while designing diversity-aware interfaces. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Diversity; Individual traits; Musical sophistication; Recommender user interfaces; Visual memory","Recommender systems; Visualization; Audio features; Diversity; Individual traits; Music recommender systems; Musical sophistication; User satisfaction; Visual memory; Visual user interfaces; User interfaces",,,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Kwon, Y., Toward more diverse recommendations: Item re-ranking methods for recommender systems (2009) Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems.

However, how to acquire and utilize the contextual information is still facing challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach for context-aware music recommendation, which infers users’ preferences for music, and then recommends music pieces that fit their real-time requirements. Specifically, the proposed approach first learns the low dimensional representations of music pieces from users’ music listening sequences using neural network models. Based on the learned representations, it then infers and models users’ general and contextual preferences for music from users’ historical listening records. Finally, music pieces in accordance with user’s preferences are recommended to the target user. Extensive experiments are conducted on real world datasets to compare the proposed method with other state-of-the-art recommendation methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms those baselines, especially on sparse data. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Context-aware; Embedding; Neural network; Recommender systems; Sequence-based",,,,,,"2015C01027

Directors (N=61) of ensembles belonging to the New Horizons International Music Association (NHIMA) served as participants in this study. Using an electronic survey instrument to collect responses, the researchers gathered information on chamber music practices within the context of the NHIMA ensemble of which the respondent was the director. Results suggest that less than half of the New Horizons ensembles currently incorporate a chamber music component into their programme. Further analysis revealed the manner in which chamber ensembles were structured, common rehearsal practices and the perceived impediments to the implementation of chamber music into a NHIMA group. The authors use these results to recommend the investigation of different chamber music models within NHIMA contexts to try and identify approaches that work, given the disparate needs of each individual NHIMA organization. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

Current music recommendation systems are facing two key challenges: (1) users' listening habits with respect to time haven't been well studied; (2) there are far less ratings than listening records in music providing systems. In this paper, we strive to address the above two challenges. We investigate when and what music will a user listen to, and we propose a Fine-grained Time-Aware Music Recommendation (FTAMR) model. To be specific, we improve recommendation qualities from two sides: The user and the song. From the user's side, we study users' listening time-behavior in a fine-grained way and explore their short-Term listening habits (e.g. in a day) and long-Term listening habits (e.g. in several months); From the song's side, considering the sparsity of ratings and the characteristics (e.g., popularity) of each song, we define the asymmetric co-recommendation probability from a song to another, and cluster songs according to co-recommendation probabilities instead of similarities. Given users' listening records with time stamps, we make recommendation based on their listening habits and songs' co-recommendation probabilities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed FTAMR model, we study the Last.fm data set and conduct extensive experiments. The results show that our approach can provide better recommendations. © 2017 IEEE.","Fine grained; Listening habits.; Music recommendation; Time aware","Probability; Fine grained; Listening habits; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Short term; Time aware; Time behavior; Time stamps; Ubiquitous computing",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 2014AA01A302, 2015AA015305, 61272151, 61472451, 61502161

In many famous music platforms in China, such as QQ Music, Wangyi Cloud Music, Xiami Music, how to recommend appropriate music to users is a very challenging issue. Most of these recommendation systems are using collaborative filtering method to recommend music. In our paper, we propose a light-weight emotion-aware approach which can analyze emotion based on the song lyric and user comments, via vector projection to decide which song can be recommended to the users in order to maximize their experiences. Two emotion lexicons had been adopted for such purposes. To validate our system, a small-scale user study has been conducted with mixed and interesting results. We offer suggestions on the adoption of each lexicon in the context of user satisfaction and use. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","Emotion-aware; Lyric; Recommendation system; User comment; Vector projection","Collaborative filtering; Information systems; Information use; Recommender systems; Collaborative filtering methods; Emotion-aware; Light weight; Lyric; Music Recommendation System; User comment; User satisfaction; Vector projection; Big data",,,,,,,,"North, A.C., Hargreaves, D.J., Hargreaves, J.J., Uses of music in everyday life (2004) Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 22 (1); Tang, T., Winoto, P., If you like the devil wears prada the book, will you also enjoy the devil wears prada the movie?

It is computationally efficient and performs well when the data is ideally full, when there are limited user inputs or few user/item inputs, it immediately lost its competitive advantage. Additionally, traditional RS techniques including content-based one heavily rely on explicit user feedback (e.g. user rating) to generate recommendations. In music/song recommendation, however, implicit feedbacks such as play frequency, play list prevail. Making recommendation on such implicit feedbacks requires efficient and accurate latent factor learning techniques to construct user or item feature space, which is inherently computationally costly. This paper presents a new and lightweight classification model for Chinese song RS based on computational analysis of the lingual part of song lyrics. Through extracting and combining the term frequency and inverse document frequency (tf∗idf) from song lyrics, we construct a composite emotion point matrix for each song which can then be used to further classify songs based on its inherent emotion and make recommendation accordingly. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Chinese song; Content-based collaborative filtering; Lyric; Recommendation system; Sentiment analysis; Term frequency and inverse document frequency","Artificial intelligence; Collaborative filtering; Competition; Data mining; Information retrieval systems; Inverse problems; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Text processing; Chinese song; Collaborative filtering techniques; Computational analysis; Computationally efficient; Content-based; Inverse Document Frequency; Lyric; Music Recommendation System; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Song, Y., Dixon, S., Pearce, M., A survey of music recommendation systems and future perspectives (2012) 9th International Symposium on Computer Music Modelling and Retrieval, CMMR, pp. 395-410. , 2012; Peng, H., Cambria, E., Hussain, A., A review of sentiment analysis research in Chinese language (2017) Cognitive Computing, 9, pp. 423-435; Kocaman, O., The effects of songs on foreign language vocabulary acquisition (2016) First Printing: 29 Th December 2016, Sakarya Publication: ICLEL Conferences Sakarya University Faculty of Education, p. 116. , 54300 Sakarya, TURKEY; Popescul, A., Ungar, L., Pennock, D., Lawrence, S., Probabilistic models for unified collaborative and content-based recommendation in sparse-data environments (2001) Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 437-444; Wang, X., Chen, X., Yang, D., Wu, Y., Music emotion classification of Chinese songs based on lyrics using TF∗IDF and rhyme (2011) 12th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, ISMIR 2011, pp. 765-770; Ullman, J., Rajaraman, A., Leskovec, J., (2013) Mining of Massive Datasets, pp. 307-341; Thompson, C., If you liked this, you're sure to love that (2008) The New York Times Magazine; Winoto, P., Tang, T., The role of user mood in movie recommendation (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (8), pp. 6086-6092. , Elsevier; Melville, P., Mooney, R.J., Nagarajan, R., Content-boosted collaborative filtering for improved recommendations (2002) 18th National Conference on Artificial Intelligence(AAAI-2002), pp. 187-192; Hu, Y., Koren, Y., Volinsky, C., Collaborative filtering for implicit feedback datasets (2008) Proc.The 2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM '08), pp. 263-272. , IEEE Press; Thayer, R.E., (1989) The Biopsychology of Mood and Arousal, , New York: Oxford University Press; Hu, Y., Chen, X., Yang, D., Lyric-based song emotion detection with affective lexicon and fuzzy clustering method (2009) Proceedings of the Intl.

Reliable emotion based classification systems can go a long way in helping us parse their meaning. However, research in the field of emotion-based music classification has not yielded optimal results. In this paper, we present an affective cross-platform music player, EMP, which recommends music based on the real-time mood of the user. EMP provides smart mood based music recommendation by incorporating the capabilities of emotion context reasoning within our adaptive music recommendation system. Our music player contains three modules: Emotion Module, Music Classification Module and Recommendation Module. The Emotion Module takes an image of the user's face as an input and makes use of deep learning algorithms to identify their mood with an accuracy of 90.23%. The Music Classification Module makes use of audio features to achieve a remarkable result of 97.69% while classifying songs into 4 different mood classes. The Recommendation Module suggests songs to the user by mapping their emotions to the mood type of the song, taking into consideration the preferences of the user. © 2017 IEEE.","Artificial neural networks; Emotion recognition; Multi-layer neural network; Music information retrieval; Recommender systems","Deep learning; Face recognition; Network layers; Neural networks; Recommender systems; Search engines; Speech recognition; Wireless telecommunication systems; Classification system; Context reasoning; Emotion recognition; Facial emotions; Music classification; Music information retrieval; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Audio acoustics",,,,,,,,"Swaminathan, S., Glenn Schellenberg, E., Current emotion research in music psychology (2015) Emotion Review, 7 (2), pp. 189-197. , Apr; How music changes your mood (2017) Examined Existence, , http://examinedexistence.com/how-music-changes-yourmood, [Online].

We envision a contextual music search and recommendation system, which could suggest appropriate music to the user in the current context. As an important step in this direction, we set out to understand what are the users’ intents for listening to music, and how they relate to common daily activities. To accomplish this, we conduct and analyze a survey of why and when people of different ages and in different countries listen to music. The resulting categories of common musical intents, and the associations of intents and activities, could be helpful for guiding the development and evaluation of contextual music recommendation systems. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Contextual music recommendation; music listening intent","Daily activity; Different ages; music listening intent; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Time of day; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"(2014) Google Activity Recognition Client, , 2014).

Although existing methods of similar retrieval or sequence prediction have attained success to some extend, one important factor has not been considered in the previous work, that is, users may change their music interest in different sessions. How to define the users’ current interest is still a problem. In this paper, we propose a topic-based probabilistic model for addressing this problem by developing session-aware latent topics to model the users’ listening behavior. The model is designed based on the insight that users’ listening behavior is subjected to not only their personal interest, but also to their special interest in the session. Specifically, when making recommendation, our model estimates the probability of the song selection based on the mixture of the two aspects with a weight-based scheme. We have conducted experiments on a real music dataset from Last.fm. The empirical results demonstrate that our model performs much better than other state-of-the-art methods. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Generative model; More; Music recommendation; Recommender systems; Topic model","Recommender systems; Software engineering; Critical technologies; Generative model; More; Music recommendation; nocv1; Probabilistic modeling; Sequence prediction; State-of-the-art methods; Topic Modeling; Soft computing",,,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: a survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions (2005) IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng, 17 (6), pp. 734-749; Almohammadi, K., Hagras, H., Yao, B., Alzahrani, A., Alghazzawi, D., Aldabbagh, G., A type-2 fuzzy logic recommendation system for adaptive teaching (2015) Soft Comput, pp. 1-15; Aucouturier, J.J., Pachet, F., Music similarity measures: What’s the use?

As more music becomes available through streaming services, deciding what music is appropriate for social events becomes increasingly challenging and nuanced. While prior work has considered the social role of music and the creation of music playlists for user contexts, how individuals utilize music to create social contexts is an area that has largely gone unexplored. To investigate this topic, we created and evaluated a prototype music recommender system called Reflektor. Reflektor interactively visualizes users' chat conversations to generate music playlists. Our analysis of user conversations with Reflektor uncovered distinct strategies participants use to create the ambiance and conduct for social contexts. Our findings help to illuminate mismatches in the way metadata and recommendation systems align with user strategies to create social context. We elaborate on these strategies and discuss design implications for future collaborative music recommender systems. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

It examines different approaches in the development of music recommendation systems (RS) which are applicable to all types of web information resources. These approaches are classified as content-based, collaborative, demographic, knowledge-based, meta-data-based, emotion-based and context-based, while the hybrid approach to RS development combines two or more approaches into one. Also, recent developments in the domain of music recommendations are discussed in detail. Finally, challenges and opportunities for collaboration between the scientific and the commercial communities on the development of new RS models are being explored. © 2018, IGI Global.

An increasing number of datasets have been compiled to facilitate research on different topics, such as content-based, context-based or next-song recommendation. However, these topics are usually addressed separately using different datasets, due to the lack of a unified dataset that contains a large variety of feature types such as item features, user contexts, and timestamps. To address this issue, we propose a large-scale benchmark dataset called #nowplaying-RS, which contains 11.6 million music listening events (LEs) of 139K users and 346K tracks collected from Twitter. The dataset comes with a rich set of item content features and user context features, and the timestamps of the LEs. Moreover, some of the user context features imply the cultural origin of the users, and some others-like hashtags-give clues to the emotional state of a user underlying an LE. In this paper, we provide some statistics to give insight into the dataset, and some directions in which the dataset can be used for making music recommendation. We also provide standardized training and test sets for experimentation, and some baseline results obtained by using factorization machines. © Proceedings of the 15th Sound and Music Computing Conference: Sonic Crossings, SMC 2018.

However, in the conversational applications, it is unable to capture users’ real time music taste, which are dynamic and depend on user context including users’ emotion, current activities or sites. To meet users’ real time music preferences, we have developed a conversational music recommender system based on music knowledge graph, MusicRoBot (Music RecOmmendation Bot). We embed the music recommendation into a chatbot, integrating both the advantages of dialogue system and recommender system. In our system, conversational interaction helps capture more real-time and richer requirements. Users can receive real time recommendation and give feedbacks by conversation. Besides, MusicRoBot also provides the music Q&A function to answer several types of musical question by the music knowledge graph.

Most existing music recommendation methods focus on exploring users' profiles, listening histories and audio signal of music to recommend the most relevant items to users. However, users' preferences may vary in different contexts or in response to changing emotions. In recent years, some studies have affirmed the important roles of context and emotions in music recommendation, and include context or emotions to their system design; however, few studies take both context and emotions simultaneously into consideration. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to enhance the prediction of a user's preference; this approach incorporates the factors of context and emotion and aims to provide users with a more simple, intuitive and enjoyable listening experience. In addition, we adopt serviced-oriented architecture to implement our music recommendation system to which new innovative services can be easily added or integrated to provide more flexible services in the future. We also present the evaluation results of the prediction accuracy and users satisfaction. © 2018 Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee.

The most existing models only focus on explicit data like ratings and other user-item dimensions. A challenging problem in music recommendation is to model a variety of contextual information, such as feedback, time and location. In this article, we proposed a competent hybrid music recommender system (HMRS), which works on context and collaborative approaches. The timestamp is extracted from users listening log to construct a decision context behavior that extracted various temporal features like a week, sessions(as morning, evening or night). We used depth-first-search (DFS) algorithm which traverses the whole graph through the paths in different contexts. Bellman-Ford algorithm provides ranked list of recommended items with multi-layer context graph. We enhanced the process using particle swarm optimization (PSO) which produced highly optimized results. The dataset is used from Last.fm which contains 19,150,868 music listening logs of 992 users (till May, 4th 2009). We extract the properties of music from user’s listening history and evaluate the efficient system to recommend music based on user’s contextual preferences. Our system noticeably delivers the best recommendations regarding recall results when compared to existing methods. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Collaborative filtering; Hybrid; Music; Particle swarm optimization; Recommender system","Collaborative filtering; Online systems; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Bellman-Ford algorithms; Collaborative approach; Contextual information; Depth-First-Search (DFS); Hybrid; Music; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: a survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions (2005) Adapt Web, 69, pp. 253-260; Alqadah, F., Reddy, C.K., Hu, J., Alqadah, H.F., Biclustering neighborhood-based collaborative filtering method for top-n recommender systems (2015) Knowl Inf Syst, 44, pp. 475-491; Awerbuch, B., Noy Bar, A., Approximate distributed Bellman-Ford algorithms (1994) IEEE Trans Commun, 42, pp. 2515-2519; Bobadilla, J., Ortega, F., Hernando, A., Gutiérrez, A., Recommender systems survey (2013) Knowledge-Based Syst, 46, pp. 109-132; Chen, S., Wang, G., Jia, W., κ-FuzzyTrust: efficient trust computation for large-scale mobile social networks using a fuzzy implicit social graph (2015) Inf Sci (Ny), 318, pp. 123-143; Chen, L., Chen, G., Wang, F., Recommender systems based on user reviews: the state of the art (2015) User Model User-adapt Interact, 25, pp. 99-154; Chen, H., Li, Z., Hu, W., An improved collaborative recommendation algorithm based on optimized user similarity (2015) J Supercomput; Christensen, I., Schiaffino, S., (2013) Matrix factorization in social group recommender systems.

To this end, the musical preferences of users in the context of music recommender systems have mostly been captured in collaborative filtering-based approaches. Alternatively, users can be characterized by their average listening behavior and hence, by the mean values of a set of content descriptors of tracks the users listened to. However, a user may listen to highly different tracks and genres. Thus, computing the average of all tracks does not capture the user’s listening behavior well. We argue that each user may have many different preferences that depend on contextual aspects (e.g., listening to classical music when working and hard rock when doing sports) and that user models should account for these different sets of preferences. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis and evaluation of different user models that describe a user’s musical preferences based on acoustic features of tracks the user has listened to. © Eva Zangerle, Martin Pichl.",,"Collaborative filtering; Acoustic features; Analysis and evaluation; Classical musics; Content descriptors; Content-based; Music information retrieval; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Andersen, J.S., Using the echo nest’s automatically extracted music features for a musicological purpose (2014) 2014 4th International Workshop on Cognitive Information Processing (CIP), pp. 1-6; Ayaki, T., Yanagimoto, H., Yoshioka, M., Recommendation from access logs with ensemble learning (2017) Artificial Life and Robotics, 22 (2), pp. 163-167; Baltrunas, L., Ludwig, B., Ricci, F., Matrix factorization techniques for context aware recommendation (2011) Proceedings of the Fifth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 301-304. , ACM; Bogdanov, D., Haro, M., Fuhrmann, F., Gómez, E., Herrera, P., Content-based music recommendation based on user preference examples (2010) 4th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems.

For an agent to be social with respect to humans, it needs to be able to parse and process the human cultural experience. That in itself gives rise to many fascinating learning problems. Music, as a general target domain, serves as an excellent testbed for these research ideas. Musical skills involve extremely advanced knowledge representation and problem solving tools. Creating agents that can interact richly with people in the music domain is a challenge that will advance social agents research and contribute important and broadly applicable AI knowledge. This belief is fueled not just by my background in computer science and artificial intelligence, but also by my deep passion for music as well as my extensive musical training. One key aspect of musical intelligence which hasn't been sufficiently studied is that of sequential decision-making. My thesis strives to answer the following question: How can a sequential decision making perspective guide us in the creation of better music agents, and social agents in general? More specifically, this thesis focuses on two aspects of musical intelligence: music recommendation and multiagent interaction in the context of music.

Although people listen to music in a context-driven manner, music recommendation services typically ignore where a user is listening to the music. They also typically select music based on a single seed song, rather than ordering a user’s created playlists for the best user experience. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) We present a survey of 15 DJs of college radio stations to identify their heuristics in creating playlists for radio shows. (2) We present an experimental study design to evaluate various scheduling (track ordering) strategies for mobile music consumption in situ, which is used to (3) conduct a field experiment that compares the user experience of three scheduling strategies (tempo, genre and location) against the gold standard of a playlist created by an experienced DJ (This work was completed when Anupriya Ankolekar and Thomas Sandholm were both researchers, and Louis Lei Yu was a postdoctoral research fellow at Hewlett Packard Labs.

In this work, we take advantage of social tags that users give to music through streaming platforms for improving recommendations. Most of the works in the literature use the tags in the context of content based methods for finding similarities between songs and artists, but we use them for characterizing users, instead of characterizing music, aiming at improving user-based collaborative filtering algorithms. The expertise level of users is inferred from the frequency analysis of their tags by using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which is an indicator of the quantity and relevance of the tags that users provide to items. User expertise has been studied in the context of recommender systems and other domains, but, as far as we know, it has not been studied in the context of music recommendations. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Collaborative filtering; Music recommender systems; Streaming services; User expertise",,,,,,,,,"McAuley, J.J., Leskovec, J., From amateurs to connoisseurs: Modeling the evolution of user expertise through online reviews (2013) Proceedings of the 22Nd International Conference on World Wide Web, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, pp. 897-908; Breese, J.S., Heckerman, D., Kadie, C., Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering (1998) Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 43-52. , Madison; Sarwar, B., Karypis, G., Konstan, J., Riedl, J., Item-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm (2001) Proceedings of the Tenth International World Wide Web Conference, pp. 285-295; Linden, G., Smith, B., York, J., Amazon.Com recommendations: Item to item collaborative filtering (2003) IEEE Internet Comput, 7 (1), pp. 76-80; Su, X., Khoshgoftaar, T.M., A survey of collaborative filtering techniques (2009) Adv.

In this work, we focus on music and analyze user demographics and music listening events in a large corpus (120,000 users, 109 events) from Last.fm to investigate whether similarity between countries in terms of cultural and socio-economic factors is reflected in music taste. To this end, we propose a tag-based model to describe the music taste of a country and correlate the resulting music profiles to Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the Quality of Government data. Spearman's rank-order correlation and Quadratic Assignment Procedure indeed indicate statistically significant weak to medium correlations of music taste and several cultural and socio-economic factors. The results will help elaborating culture-aware models of music listeners and in turn likely yield improved music recommender systems. © 2017 IEEE.","cultural studies; music; social media analysis","Cultural backgrounds; Cultural studies; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; music; Music recommender systems; Quadratic assignment; Social media analysis; Socio-economic factor; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Garcia-Gavilanes, R., Quercia, D., Jaimes, A., Cultural dimensions in twitter: Time, individualism and power (2013) Proc.

In this paper, we present a kind of embedding model based on user preference and context information, to recommend sequential music playlists to users. We regard songs, users, and contextual labels as points embedded in a Euclidean space through a Markov chain model, and the distances among the points in the embedding model reflect the relationship among songs, users, and contextual labels. Given a song, a playlist with the highest probability will be generated according to the embedding model.

But more urgently, the current revolution in the music industry represents major opportunities and challenges for recommendation systems in general. Recommendation systems are now central to music streaming platforms, which are rapidly increasing in listenership and becoming the top source of revenue for the music industry. It is increasingly more common for a music listener to simply access music than to purchase and own it in a personal collection. In this scenario, recommendation calls no longer for a one-shot recommendation for the purpose of a track or album purchase, but for a recommendation of a listening experience, comprising a very wide range of challenges, such as sequential recommendation, or conversational and contextual recommendations. Recommendation technologies now impact all actors in the rich and complex music industry ecosystem (listeners, labels, music makers and producers, concert halls, advertisers, etc.). To highlight these developments, we focus on three use cases: automatic playlist generation, contextaware music recommendation, and recommendation in the creative process of music making. ©2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,"Automatic playlist generation; Contextual recommendations; Hybrid recommendation; Mobile recommendations; Multiple modalities; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Recommendation technologies; Recommender systems",,,,,"Austrian Science Fund, FWF: P25655

In this paper, we study the problem of personalized music recommendation that takes different kinds of auxiliary information into consideration. To achieve this goal, a Heterogeneous Information Graph (HIG) is first constructed to encode different kinds of heterogeneous information, including the interactions between users and music pieces, music playing sequences, and the metadata of music pieces. Based on HIG, a Heterogeneous Information Graph Embedding method (HIGE) is proposed to learn the latent low-dimensional representations of music pieces. Then, we further develop a context-aware music recommendation method. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world datasets to compare the proposed method with other state-of-the-art recommendation methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms those baselines, especially on sparse datasets. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Auxiliary information; Heterogeneous information; Low-dimensional representation; Music interaction; Music recommendation; Real-world datasets; Recommendation methods; State of the art; Neural networks",,,,,"2015C01027

Thus, the amount of available music has increased dramatically and music streaming platforms heavily rely on recommender systems to assist users in discovering music they like. Incorporating the context of users has been shown to improve the quality of recommendations. Previous approaches based on pre-filtering suffered from a split dataset. In this work, we present a context-aware recommender system based on factorization machines that extracts information about the user's context from the names of the user's playlists. Based on a dataset comprising 15,000 users and 1.8 million tracks we show that our proposed approach outperforms the pre-iltering approach substantially in terms of accuracy of the computed recommendations. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We reviewed 19 experimental contextual music systems and found that while the context factors of location, time, activity, and identity are adopted in a wide variety of ways, the systems mainly rely on common UI solutions for interacting with these factors. Specifically, context factors could be employed to offer explanations, transparency, and visualizations of music recommendations in more explorative ways, providing novel user experiences. Based on our review, we provide implications for design and research on future media discovery systems, which we believe can realize the great potential of context-aware content services. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"User interfaces;

For example, selection of music in a foggy mountain is totally different with music selections in traffic jam or human sensation for listening to music on a weekend morning is extremely different with a research day's afternoon. In this study, context information which can impact on user's choices is evaluated through psychology of music inclinations, context information used in related researches and studies and also smartphones limitations and entirely most appropriate scheme will be offered.

People listen to it wherever they are. However, there is the problem that listeners would like to have the right music for their current situation without much effort and interaction. Information systems can support this need by making use of ubiquitous and context-aware music recommendation systems. This paper will focus on the user's context in form of long-term seasonal factors combined with the music features. Therefore, a music dataset with 3644 songs and 10932 data points of audio features were used and compared with seasonal aspects. The analysis shows seasonal influences on the music consumption. A positive correlation between the music parameters valence as well as energy and the monthly temperature has been detected. In contrast to winter season more active, energetic and happy songs are preferred during summer. The findings can serve to integrate seasonal adjustments to context-aware, ubiquitous music recommender systems. © ACIS 2017.","Context-Aware Recommender System; Music Data Analysis; Music Information Retrieval; Seasonal Music Recommendation; Ubiquitous Computing","Information systems; Information use; Recommender systems; Context aware ,; Current situation; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Music recommender systems; Positive correlations; Seasonal adjustments; Seasonal factors; Audio acoustics",,,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions (2005) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17 (6), pp. 734-749; (1994) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder, , American Psychiatric Association.

Indeed, not all user interests are the same in all contextual situations, especially for the case of a mobile environment. In this paper, we introduces a multi-dimensional context model for music recommender systems that solicits users’ perceptions to define the relationship between their judgment of items relevance and contextual dimensions. We have started by the acquisition of explicit items rating from a population in various possible contextual situations. Next, we have applied the Multi Linear Regression technique on users’ perceived ratings, to define an order of importance between contextual dimensions and generate the multi-dimensional context model. We summarized key results and discussed findings that can be used to build an effective mobile context-aware music recommender system. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Context model; Multi Linear Regression; Recommender systems","Computer music; Intelligent systems; Context modeling; Context-aware recommender systems; Contextual dimensions; Contextual information; Mobile environments; Multi dimensional; Multi-linear regression; Music recommender systems; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Jannach, D., Preface to the special issue on context-aware recommender systems (2014) User Model.

The objective of this paper is to present the project of a contextual moodbased music recommender system capable of regulating the driver’s mood and trying to have a positive influence on her driving behaviour.

Some of the proposed playlist models take into consideration the current song and a number of previous songs, i.e., the song context, in order to predict the next song. However, it is not yet clear to what extent knowing this song context improves next-song predictions. To shed light on this question, we conduct a numerical experiment on two datasets of hand-curated music playlists, where we compare playlist models that account for different song context lengths. Our results indicate that knowing the song context seems, at first, uninformative. However, we explain this e.ect by a strong bias in the data towards very popular songs and observe that, in fact, songs in the long tail are more accurately predicted when the song context is considered.","Music playlist generation; Music recommender systems; Recurrent neural networks","Collaborative filtering; Computer music; Recommender systems; Sound recording; Content-based; Long tail; Music playlist generation; Music recommender systems; Numerical experiments; Popular song; Sequential mode; Recurrent neural networks",,,,,,,,"Celma, O., (2010) Music Recommendation and Discovery, , Springer; Hidasi, B., Session-based recommendations with recurrent neural networks (2016) Proc.

In the process, I argue for the development of authentically poietic spaces, or communities of response, within music education contexts. Further, I recommend situating technology within those spaces in such ways as to empower otherwise vulnerable young musicians to explore their own interests, idiosyncratic ways of learning, and the deterritorialized, subjective-social worlds they inhabit. The first section of the chapter addresses the particularized nature of technology within music education contexts. The second section includes examples of technology without music education. The final section lists conclusions that attempt to situate technology in and across those two broad domains. © Oxford University Press 2017.","Communities of response; Deterritorialization; Music learning; Poiesis; Technology; Vulnerability",,,,,,,,,"Apple, M.W., (2000) Official Knowledge: Democratic Education in a Conservative Age, , New York: Routledge; (2014) The Poetics, , J.

However, the majority of Recommender Systems generate isolate item recommendations based mainly on user-item interactions, without taking into account other important information about the recommendation moment, able to deliver users a more complete experience. In this paper, a hybrid Case-based Reasoning model generating recommendations of sets of music items, based on the underlying structures found in previous playlists, is proposed. Furthermore, the described system takes into account the similarity of the basic contextual information of the current and the past recommendation moments. The initial evaluation shows that the proposed approach may deliver recommendations of equal and higher accuracy than some of the widely used techniques. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

We evaluate our method on about 7,000 K-pop tracks labeled as positive or negative emotion. The proposed method is compared to end-To-end unimodal models using audio signals or lyrics only. The experimental results show that our multimodal model achieves the best accuracy as 80%, and we discuss the reasons of these results.","Multimodal neural network; Music emotion recognition; Music recommendation","Recommender systems; Speech recognition; Acoustic signals; Audio signal; Context-aware recommendations; Multi-modal neural networks; Multimodal modeling; Music emotions; Music recommendation; Recognizing emotions; Deep neural networks",,,,,,,,"Choi, K., Fazekas, G., Sandler, M., Cho, K., (2016) Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Music Classification, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.04243 (2016); Coutinho, E., Trigeorgis, G., Zafeiriou, S., Schuller, B.W., Automatically estimating emotion in music with deep long-short term memory recurrent neural networks (2015) Working Notes Proceedings of the MediaEval 2015 Workshop; Hu, X., Downie, J.S., When lyrics outperform audio for music mood classification: A feature analysis (2010) 11th ISMIR 2010, pp. 619-624; Huang, M., Rong, W., Arjannikov, T., Jiang, N., Xiong, Z., Bi-modal deep boltzmann machine based musical emotion classification (2016) ICANN, pp. 199-207. , 2016; Laurier, C., Grivolla, J., Herrera, P., Multimodal music mood classification using audio and lyrics (2008) 7th ICMLA 2008, pp. 688-693; Wu, B., Zhong, E., Horner, A., Yang, Q., Music emotion recognition by multi-label multi-layer multi-instance multi-view learning (2014) ACM MM, pp. 117-126. , 2014; Yang, Y.-H., Lin, Y.-C., Su, Y.-F., Chen, H.H., A regression approach to music emotion recognition (2008) IEEE Trans.

But the notion of context - that describes the user, item or how users interact with the recommendation system has become one of the most significant factors that has increased the potency of recommendation systems in distinct domains such as e-commerce, movies, music, tourism etc. The main key issues in context aware recommendations are how to utilize the contextual information efficiently. So to utilize this information efficiently, an innovative cluster based context-aware post-filtering approach has been propounded that implicitly segregates the users into clusters on the basis of high performing contextual dimensions; combine the clusters on the basis of contextual similarity and then re-rank the items according to the probability of relevance in a cluster. The proposed approach is validated on movies dataset consisting of different contextual dimensions. The empirical analysis validates that the propounded approach surpass various state-of-the-art approaches. © 2017 The Authors.

The intent is to design a framework where the robot can learn the user's preferences (likes and dislikes) over time based on facial expression as a form of feedback. By extracting emotional cues from facial expression, we can then compute the intensity of a given expression on the user and adapt the robot's services accordingly. To illustrate the application of this system, we use the case study of an emotion-aware music recommendation system.","Elderly people; Emotion recognition; Facial expression; Service personalisation","Mobile computing; Robots; Elderly people; Elderly populations; Emotion recognition; Facial Expressions; Music Recommendation System; Personalisation; Social robots; User's preferences; Machine design",,,,,,,,"Tinney, J., (2007) Best Practice in Person-centred Health Care for Older Victorians, , National Ageing Research Institute; O'Connor, D., Personhood in dementia care: Developing a research agenda for broadening the vision (2007) Dementia, 6 (1), pp. 121-142; Cohen-Mansfield, J., Parpura-Gill, A., Golander, H., Utilization of self-identity roles for designing interventions for persons with dementia (2006) Journals of Gerontology: Series B, 61 (4), pp. 202-212; Robin, S.S., (1999) Preservation of the Self in the Oldest Years: With Implications for Practive, , Springer; Cohen-Mansfield, J., Parpura-Gill, A., Golander, H., Utilization of self-identity roles for designing interventions for persons with dementia (2006) The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, 61 (4), pp. P202-P212; O'Connor, D.W., Psychosocial treatments of behavior symptoms in dementia: A systematic review of reports meeting quality standards (2009) International Psychogeriatrics, 21 (2), pp. 225-240; Rogers, J.C., Excess disability during morning care in nursing home residents with dementia (2000) International Psychogeriatrics, 12 (2), pp. 267-282; Chenoweth, L., Caring for aged dementia care resident study (CADRES) of person-centred care, dementia-care mapping, and usual care in dementia: A cluster-randomised trial (2009) The Lancet Neurology, 8 (4), pp. 317-325; Cohen-Mansfield, J., Libin, A., Marx, M.S., Nonpharmacological treatment of agitation: A controlled trial of systematic individualized intervention (2007) The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences, 62 (8), pp. 908-916; Gibson, G., Housing and connection to nature for people with dementia (2007) Journal of Housing for the Elderly, 21 (1-2), pp. 55-72; Detweiler, M.B., Does a wander garden influence inappropriate behaviors in dementia residents?

Music lovers create music playlists for various contexts and activities they are engaged in, and this is done manually by updating and loading new playlist each time a user changes activity or context. This does not make music listening enjoyable as much time and effort is spent on searching for songs that befit the current context and activity. This paper proposes a personalized context-aware music recommendation system, called MPlist, that dynamically and automatically creates a music playlist for music lovers based on their context (i.e., current location and activity), listening preference, nearby users listening profiles, other users listening preferences and music from labels and tags mined from music experts and the web. MPlist collects data from multiple sensors in a user's smart mobile device and uses them to infer the user's context and activity, thereby generating a playlist based on contextual preference. This approach has the advantage of solving the well-known cold start problem yet giving music lovers a personalized anywhere anytime music listening experience. MPlist classifier is built using both kNN and rule-based learning algorithms using sensor datasets and context-aware listening profile dataset. The context-analytic engine infers basic user activities and sends all the inferred content to the content provider so that the server can learn the music preferences given a particular context. The system exhibit performance as follows: accuracy is 0.944, F-measure is 0.945, and RMSE is 0.0978. This tends to suggest that context-aware music recommendation systems is probably what music lover expect from music stores. © 2016 IEEE.","Context recognition; data mining; machine learning; mobile social networks; music; sensors; smart devices","Classification (of information); Consumer electronics; Data mining; Learning systems; Mobile devices; Recommender systems; Sensors; Cold start problems; Context recognition; Mobile social networks; music; Music preferences; Music Recommendation System; Rule-based learning; Smart devices; Learning algorithms",,,,,"Tshwane University of Technology, TUT","This work is support by the Computer Systems Engineering department of the Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Otebolaku, A.M., Andrade, M.T., Context-aware media recommendations (2014) Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (WAINA), 2014 28th International Conference on, pp. 191-196; Yang, Y.-H., Chen, H.H., Machine recognition of music emotion: A review (2012) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 3, p. 40; Xia, F., Asabere, N.Y., Ahmed, A.M., Li, J., Kong, X., Mobile multimedia recommendation in smart communities: A survey (2013) Access, IEEE, 1, pp. 606-624; Yu, Z., Zhou, X., Zhang, D., Chin, C.-Y., Wang, X., Men, J., Supporting context-aware media recommendations for smart phones (2006) Pervasive Computing, IEEE, 5, pp. 68-75; Chen, G., Kotz, D., A survey of context-aware mobile computing research (2000) Technical Report TR2000-381, , Dept. of Computer Science, Dartmouth College; Hariri, N., Mobasher, B., Burke, R., Contextaware music recommendation based on latenttopic sequential patterns (2012) Proceedings of the Sixth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 131-138; Su, J.-H., Yeh, H.-H., Yu, P.S., Tseng, V.S., Music recommendation using content and context information mining (2010) Intelligent Systems, IEEE, 25, pp. 16-26; Teng, Y.-C., Kuo, Y.-S., Yang, Y.-H., A large insitu dataset for context-aware music recommendation on smartphones (2013) Multimedia and Expo Workshops (ICMEW), 2013 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 1-4; Wang, X., Rosenblum, D., Wang, Y., Contextaware mobile music recommendation for daily activities (2012) Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 99-108; Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Context-aware recommender systems (2011) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 217-253. , ed: Springer; Howe, M., Pandora's music recommender (2009) A Case Study, I, pp. 1-6; Lukowicz, P., Ferscha, A., From context awareness to socially aware computing (2011) IEEE Pervasive Computing, pp. 32-41; Su, X., Tong, H., Ji, P., Activity recognition with smartphone sensors (2014) Tsinghua Science and Technology, 19, pp. 235-249; Wilde, A.G., An overview of human activity detection technologies for pervasive systems (2010) Department of Informatics University of Fribourg, Switzerland, 212; Aggarwal, C.C., Philip, S.Y., An introduction to privacy-preserving data mining (2008) Privacypreserving Data Mining, pp. 1-9. , ed: Springer; Christin, D., Reinhardt, A., Kanhere, S.S., Hollick, M., A survey on privacy in mobile participatory sensing applications (2011) Journal of Systems and Software, 84, pp. 1928-1946",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Innovative Business Practices for the Transformation of Societies, EmergiTech 2016","3 August 2016 through 6 August 2016",,124906,,9781509007066,,,"English","IEEE Int.

An effective music recommendation can decrease listener’s effort in choosing music that will be listened. Music recommendation is not only can be obtained based on genre or audio similarity, because listener’s music choices are also influenced by the listener’s context (mood, occasion, part of day, date, weather, region, month, and weekday). This research used Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) for determining music recommendation based on listener’s context data and also Self Organizing Map (SOM) which is used as an indexing method in CBR. Inputs given by user to the system are user’s occasion and mood desired by user. The system output is a playlist consists of music that suitable with user’s context and desired mood.Precision value produced by the system that used SOM as an indexing method is 0.867. It showed that the recommendation produced by the system is 86.7% relevant according to the user. © 2016 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Considering the influence of temporal context and hierarchical structure on emotion in music, we propose a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (DBLSTM) based multi-scale regression method. In this method, a post-processing component is utilised for individual DBSLTM output to further enhance the ability of temporal context processing and a fusion component is to integrate the output of all DBLSTM models with different scales. In addition, we investigate how the difference of sequence length between the training and predicting phase affects the performance of DBLSTM.

In this paper, we address the issue of recommending personalized music to smartphone users and propose Smart-DJ. Smart-DJ incorporates an evolutionary model called Incremental Regression Tree, which incrementally collects contextual data, music data and user feedback to characterize his/her personal taste of music. An efficient recommending algorithm is designed to make accurate recommendations within bounded latency.

Quick and easy selecting favorite music among these large archives becomes one of the biggest problems for users. For example, selecting music in a silent forest is different from a crowded street or feelings for listening to music in a morning of a working day is different from an afternoon of a holiday. In this paper, a system has been designed that it collects users' context information such as weather, temperature, geographical position, etc., and according to a weighted combination of them, it recommends an appropriate music that is a user's favorite at the moment. Thus, this system includes a rating method that determines how close are music's context, which have been played before, in the moment's context and recommend the music that has the most closeness. The result of this research shows that recommendations that this system makes in different conditions, is closed to the user's choice. © 2016 IEEE.","Behavior analyze; Contextual information; Music interest's psychology; Music recommendation system","Cellular telephone systems; Mobile phones; World Wide Web; Behavior analyze; Context information; Contextual information; Geographical positions; Intelligent cells; Music interest's psychology; Music players; Music Recommendation System; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Schilit, B., Adams, N., Want, R., Context-Aware computing applications (1994) Mobile Computing Systems and Applications 1994.

However, how to acquire and utilize the contextual information still need to be studied. In this paper, we propose a context aware music recommendation approach, which can recommend music appropriate for users' contextual preference for music. In analogy to matrix factorization methods for collaborative filtering, the proposed approach does not require songs to be described by features beforehand, but it learns music pieces' embeddings (vectors in low-dimensional continuous space) from music playing records and corresponding metadata and infer users' general and contextual preference for music from their playing records with the learned embedding. Then, our approach can recommend appropriate music pieces. Experimental evaluations on a real world dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods. © 2016 ACM.","Context aware recommendation; Embedding; Music recommendation; Recommender systems","Factorization; Metadata; Recommender systems; Vector spaces; Context-aware recommendations; Contextual factors; Contextual information; Continuous spaces; Embedding; Experimental evaluation; Matrix factorizations; Music recommendation; Collaborative filtering",,,,,"2014BAD10B02

Consequently, there has been an increasing demand in studying intelligent techniques to facilitate context-aware music recommendation. However, one important context that is generally overlooked is user’s venue, which often includes surrounding atmosphere, correlates with activities, and greatly influences the user’s music preferences. In this article, we present a novel venue-aware music recommender system called VenueMusic to effectively identify suitable songs for various types of popular venues in our daily lives. Toward this goal, a Location-aware Topic Model (LTM) is proposed to (i) mine the common features of songs that are suitable for a venue type in a latent semantic space and (ii) represent songs and venue types in the shared latent space, in which songs and venue types can be directly matched. It is worth mentioning that to discover meaningful latent topics with the LTM, a Music Concept Sequence Generation (MCSG) scheme is designed to extract effective semantic representations for songs. An extensive experimental study based on two large music test collections demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed topic model and MCSG scheme. The comparisons with state-of-the-art music recommender systems demonstrate the superior performance of VenueMusic system on recommendation accuracy by associating venue and music contents using a latent semantic space. This work is a pioneering study on the development of a venue-aware music recommender system. The results show the importance of considering the influence of venue types in the development of context-aware music recommender systems. © 2016 ACM","Algorithms; Design; Experimentation; Human factors","Algorithms; Data mining; Design; Human engineering; Semantics; Effective location; Experimentation; Intelligent techniques; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Recommendation accuracy; Semantic representation; Sequence generation; Recommender systems",,,,,"Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE: MOE2013-T2-2-156","This work is supported by Singapore Ministry of Education under Academic Research Fund Tier-2 (MOE Ref: MOE2013-T2-2-156).

Fatigue and negative emotions such as anger adversely affect driver performance, thereby increasing the risk involved in driving. Research has shown that listening to the right kind of music in these situations can ameliorate driver performance and improve road safety. Context-aware music delivery systems succeed in delivering suitable music according to the situation through the process of music mood-mapping which identifies the mood of a song. Additionally, we can leverage the power of the cloud to enable crowd sensing of the mood-mapping of various songs and enhance the effectiveness of situation-aware music delivery for drivers. The cloud can be used to aggregate the crowd sensed music mood-mapping data and improve the effectiveness of music delivery by providing accurate mood-mappings from the aggregated data. Currently, context-aware music delivery systems consider only features from the song for music mood-mapping. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to music mood-mapping for drivers which also incorporates the social context of a driver including age, gender and cultural background to enhance the effectiveness of music delivery in context-aware music recommendation systems for drivers. © 2015 IEEE.","Cloud; Context-aware; Crowd sensing; Music mood-mapping; Safe driving","Accidents; Aggregates; Cloud computing; Clouds; Highway accidents; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Aggregated datum; Context-Aware; Crowd sensing; Cultural backgrounds; Delivery systems; Driver performance; Music Recommendation System; Safe driving; Mapping",,,,,,,,"World Health Organization, (2014) World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention, , http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/world_report/en; (2015) A Study by Transport-European Commission, , http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/specialist/knowledge/fatique/index_en.htm, European Commission; Zwaag, M., Dijksterhuis, C., Waard, D., Mulder, B., Westerink, J., Brookhuis, K., The influence of music on mood and performance while driving (2012) Ergonomics, 55 (1), pp. 12-22; Helmholz, P., Vetter, S., Bissantz, S., AmbiTune: Bringing context-awareness to music playlists while driving (2014) Advancing the Impact of Design Science: Moving from Theory to Practice. 8463, pp. 393-397. , Springer International Publishing; Hu, X., Deng, J., Zhao, J., Hu, W., Ngai, E.C.-H., Wang, R., Shen, J., Kwok, Y., SAfeDJ: A crowd-cloud co-design approach to situation-aware music delivery for drivers (2015) ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications and Applications, 12 (1 S); Hu, X., Deng, J., Hu, W., Fotopoulos, G., Ngai, E.C.-H., Sheng, Z., Liang, M., Fels, S., SAfeD j community: Situation-aware in-car music delivery for safe driving (2014) Proc.

Thus, music recommender systems got in the focus of research in academia as well as industry. Collaborative filtering-based recommender systems have been proven useful, but there is space left for improvements by adapting this general approach to better fit to the music recommendations problem. In this work, we incorporate context-based information about the music consumption into the recommendation process. This information is extracted from playlist names, which are analyzed and aggregated into so-called ""contextual clusters"". We find that the listening context plays an important role and thus allows for providing recommendations reaching precision values 33% higher than traditional approaches. Hence, the main contribution of this paper is a new method that extracts and integrates contextual information from playlist names into the recommendation process for improving music recommendations. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Collaborative filtering; Recommender systems; Context-based information; Contextual information; Distribution channel; Focus of researches; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Music streaming; Traditional approaches; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Zangerle, E., Gassler, W., Specht, G., Exploiting twitter's collective knowledge for music recommendations (2012) Proc. of the 2nd Workshop on Making Sense of Microposts (#MSM2012): Big Things Come in Small Packages; Pichl, M., Eva, Z., Specht, G., Nowplaying on #Spotify: Leveraging Spotify Information on Twitter for Artist Recommendations (2015) Proc. of First Intl.

Especially online music streaming services are in trend-sensitive industry, hence largely affected by user’s experience and reputation. Conventional music streaming services provide users keywords-based search for music. Accordingly it strongly relies on user’s prior knowledge and experience. It often fails to expose non-expert users to the music that the users are not familiar with. In this paper, we suggest an emotion-aware music recommendation system that proposes songs and artists based on the mood of each user. First, we infer user’s emotion using real-time weather information. Second, we classify songs and artists which are favorable in different weather conditions. To do so, we collect and combine daily chart of K-pop music and weather history data to find the music preference in different weather. It is used to recommend timely and favorable music to users after capturing their mood implcitly. Moreover the emotion-aware music recommendation system is extensible to provide a personalized service by using user’s social media, heartbeat, time, location, and so on. We expect this would enrich user experience noticeably. Being aware of user’s emotion will enable broad areas of industry to provide intelligent services in a user-friendly way. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Data mining; Emotion-aware system; Recommendation system","Data mining; Human computer interaction; Emotion-aware systems; Intelligent Services; Music preferences; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Music streaming; Personalized service; Weather information; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"(2015) Global Sales of Recorded Music, 24p. , Recording Industry Association of Japan; http://www.wunderground.com/history; http://music.bugs.co.kr/chart?wl_ref=M_left_02_01; Nanopoulos, A., Musicbox: Personalized music recommendation based on cubic analysis of social tags (2010) IEEE Trans.

As one of the most important context features,user emotion has great potential to improve recommendations,but this has not yet been sufficiently explored due to the difficulty of emotion acquisition and incorporation. This paper proposes a graph-based emotion-aware music recommendation approach (GEMRec) by simultaneously taking a user’s music listening history and emotion into consideration. The proposed approach models the relations between user,music,and emotion as a three-element tuple (user,music,emotion),upon which an Emotion Aware Graph (EAG) is built,and then a relevance propagation algorithm based on random walk is devised to rank the relevance of music items for recommendation. Evaluation experiments are conducted based on a real dataset collected from a Chinese microblog service in comparison to baselines. The results show that the emotional context from a user’s microblogs contributes to improving the performance of music recommendation in terms of hitrate,precision,recall,and F1 score. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Emotion analysis; Emotion aware; Music recommendation; Random walk","Information systems; Random processes; Systems engineering; Context features; Emotion analysis; Emotion aware; Evaluation experiments; Listening history; Music recommendation; Propagation algorithm; Random Walk; Graphic methods",,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: LP140100937

While previous approaches for the task of determining the origin of music either focused solely on exploiting the audio content or web resources, we propose a method that fuses features from both sources in a way that outperforms standalone approaches. To this end, we propose the use of block-level features inferred from the audio signal to model music content. We show that these features outperform timbral and chromatic features previously used for the task. On the other hand, we investigate a variety of strategies to construct web-based predictors from web pages related to music pieces. We assess different parameters for this kind of predictors (e.g., number of web pages considered) and define a confidence threshold for prediction. Fusing the proposed audio-and web-based methods by a weighted Borda rank aggregation technique, we show on a previously used dataset of music from 33 countries around the world that the median placing error can be reduced from 1,815 to 0 kilometers using K-nearest neighbor regression. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Audio signal processing; Information retrieval; Nearest neighbor search; Websites; Chromatic features; Confidence threshold; K-nearest neighbors; Location-aware; Music contents; Music information retrieval; Music retrieval; Rank aggregation; Audio acoustics",,,,,"Austrian Science Fund, FWF: P25655","This research is supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): P25655.

It is a great challenge for users to find their interested songs from such a large size of collections. In the previous studies, common strategies can be categorized into content-based music recommendation and collaborative music filtering. Content-based recommendation systems predict users’ preferences in terms of the music content. Collaborative filtering systems predict users’ ratings based on the preferences of the friends of the targeting user. In this study, we proposed a hybrid approach to provide personalized music recommendations. This is achieved by extracting audio features of songs and integrating these features and user personalities for context-aware recommendation using the state-of-the-art support vector machines (SVM).

However, additional sources of data such as demographic attributes of listeners, their listening behaviour, and their listening contexts encode information about listeners, and their listening habits, that may be used to improve the accuracy of music recommendation models. In this paper we introduce a large dataset of music listening histories with listeners’ demographic information, and a set of features to characterize aspects of people’s listening behaviour. The longevity of the collected listening histories, covering over two years, allows the retrieval of basic forms of listening context. We use this dataset in the evaluation of accuracy of a music artist recommendation model learned from past preferences of listeners on music items and their interaction with several combinations of people’s demographic, profiling, and contextual features. Our results indicate that using listeners’ self-declared age, country, and gender improve the recommendation accuracy by 8 percent. When a new profiling feature termed exploratoryness was added, the accuracy of the model increased by 12 percent. © Gabriel Vigliensoni and Ichiro Fujinaga.",,"Large dataset; Population statistics; Contextual feature; Demographic information; Listening history; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Recommendation accuracy; Recommender systems",,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","This research has been supported by BecasChile Bicente-nario, Comisión Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, Go-bierno de Chile, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

In this paper, we present an approach that discovers user behavior from a large-scale, real-world listening record. The proposed approach generates a latent representation of users, listening sessions, and songs, where each of these objects is represented as a point in the multi-dimensional latent space. Since the distance between two points is an indication of the similarity of the two corresponding objects, it becomes extremely simple to evaluate the similarity between songs or the matching of songs with the user preference. By exploiting this feature, we provide a two-dimensional user behavior analysis framework for music recommendation. Exploring the relationships between user preference and the contextual or temporal information in the session data through this framework significantly facilitates personalized music recommendation. We provide experimental results to illustrate the strengths of the proposed approach for user behavior analysis. © Chia-Hao Chung, Jing-Kai Lou, Homer Chen.",,"Information retrieval; Behavior analysis; Multi dimensional; Music recommendation; Personalizations; Real-world; Temporal information; User behavior analysis; User behaviors; Behavioral research",,,,,,,,"Kaminskas, M., Ricci, F., Contextual music information retrieval and recommendation: State of the art and challenges (2012) Comput.

As it is an important aspect in the use of multi-media systems and the music industry, it is important to note that the typical approach is through collaborative-filtering. In this paper, the study considered a more personalized view and examined to which degree a user’s music preference can be modeled using information gathered from the user with respect to their listening behavior and music selected. The study proposes an approach to modeling a user’s music preference using a series of usage scores obtained from a user’s listening behavior and to generate a playlist derived from the obtained model. Using a novel data set, the proposed approach resulted to an average True-Positive rating of 54.43% in predicting music files that the user will select for the month given the previous month’s data and an overall performance of 82.53% in producing entries to a preferred playlist, showing the possibility of more refinements and further study. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Computational modeling; Music preference; Recommendation; User modeling","Behavioral research; Collaborative filtering; Computation theory; Multi agent systems; Computational model; Multi-Media; Music industry; Music preferences; Personalized views; Recommendation; True positive; User Modeling; Computer music",,,,,,,,"Aquino, R.J., Battad, J.R., Ngo, C.F., Uy, G., Trogo, R., Suarez, M., Towards empathic music provision for computer users (2011) 2011 Third International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering, pp. 245-251; (2008) Audacity 2.0.3 [Computer Program], , http://audacity.sourceforge.net/, Accessed 5 Jan 2013; Gunawardana, A., Shani, G., Evaluating recommender systems (2011) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 257-297. , Ricci, F., Rokach, L., Shapira, B.

User emotion, as one of the most important contexts, has the potential to improve music recommendation, but has not yet been fully explored due to the great difficulty of emotion acquisition. This article utilizes users' microblogs to extract their emotions at different granularity levels and during different time windows. The approach then correlates three elements: user, music and the user's emotion when he/she is listening to the music piece. Based on the associations extracted from a data set crawled from a Chinese Twitter service, we develop several emotion-aware methods to perform music recommendation. We conduct a series of experiments and show that the proposed solution proves that considering user emotional context can indeed improve recommendation performance in terms of hit rate, precision, recall, and F1 score. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Image Hub Explorer was made with the goal of raising awareness of the hubness phenomenon and offering potential solutions by implementing state-of-the-art hubness-aware metric learning, ranking and classification methods. Various visualization components allow for a quick identification of critical issues and we hope that they will prove helpful in working with large image datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented methods in various object recognition tasks. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Hubness; Image retrieval; k-nearest neighbors; Machine learning; Object recognition; Visualization","Artificial intelligence; Content based retrieval; Data visualization; Flow visualization; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Object recognition; Visualization; Classification methods; Content based image retrieval; Critical issues; Curse of dimensionality; Hubness; K-nearest neighbors; State of the art; Visualization and analysis; Image retrieval",,,,,,,,"Aggarwal, C.C., Hinneburg, A., Keim, D.A., (2001) On the surprising behavior of distance metrics in high dimensional spaces.

Research has shown that fatigue can adversely affect driving performance and increase risk of road accidents. It has been shown that driving performance is enhanced by stress-relieving music which thereby promotes safer driving. Context-aware music delivery systems promote safer driving through intelligent music recommendations based on contextual knowledge. Two key aspects of situation-aware music delivery are effectiveness and efficiency of music recommendation. Efficiency is a critical aspect in real-time context based music recommendation as the music delivery system should quickly sense any change in the situation and deliver suitable music before the sensed context-data becomes obsolete. We focus on the efficiency of situation-aware music delivery systems in this paper. Music mood-mapping is a process which helps in understanding the mood of a song and is hence used in situation-aware music recommendation systems. This process requires a large processing time due to the complex calculations and large sizes of music files involved. Hence, optimizing this process is the key to improving the efficiency of context-aware music delivery systems. Here, we propose a novel cloud and crowd-sensing based approach to considerably optimize the efficiency of situation-aware music delivery systems. © 2015 ACM.","Cloud; Context-aware; Crowd-sensing; Mood-mapping; Music matching; Music recommendation; Offloading; Vehicular sensor application","Accidents; Automobile drivers; Clouds; Complex networks; Highway accidents; Mapping; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Transportation; Context-Aware; Crowd-sensing; Music matching; Music recommendation; Offloading; Sensor applications; Efficiency",,,,,,,,"World report on road traffic injury prevention, (2014) World Health Organization (WHO), , http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/world_report/en; A study by Transport - European Commission, http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/specialist/knowledge/fatique/index_en.htm; Zwaag, M., Dijksterhuis, C., Waard, D., Mulder, B.L.J.M., Westerink, J.H.D.M., Brookhuis, K.A., The influence of music on mood and performance while driving (2012) Ergonomics, 55 (1), pp. 12-22; Hu, X., Deng, J., Zhao, J., Hu, W., Ngai, E.C.-H., Wang, R., Shen, J., Kwok, Y., SAfeDJ: A crowd-cloud co-design approach to situationaware music delivery for drivers (2015) ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications and Applications, , To appear in; Hu, X., Deng, J., Hu, W., Fotopoulos, G., Ngai, E.C.-H., Sheng, Z., Liang, M., Fels, S., SAfeDJ community: Situation-aware in-car music delivery for safe driving (2014) Proc.

This paper proposes a photo-taking application which reminds users with attractive scenes based on the location, photos recently taken, and photos contributed on the Internet. With an analysis of the photos on cloud-based album or social media, we combine the current context of user to recommend other nearby scenes that the user had missed to include in his/her collection. To evaluate our concept, we had tried to implement a prototype system with the use of geographical tags and scene recognition techniques to find out the similarities between photos.

The idea is to recommend information that a user would be interested in according to the user's surrounding context. Although remarkable progress has been made to contextualize music playback, relatively little research has been made using a large collection of real-life listening records collected in situ. In light of this fact, we present in this article a quantitative study of the personal, situational, and musical factors of musical preference in a smartphone context, using a new dataset comprising the listening records and self-report context annotation of 48 participants collected over 3wk via an Android app. Although the number of participants is limited and the population is biased towards students, the dataset is unique in that it is collected in a daily context, with sensor data and music listening profiles recorded at the same time. We investigate 3 core research questions evaluating the strength of a rich set of low-level and high-level audio features for music usage auto-tagging (i.e., music preference in different user activities), the strength of time-domain and frequency-domain sensor features for user activity classification, and how user factors such as personality traits are correlated with the predictability of music usage and user activity, using a closed set of 8 activity classes. We provide an in-depth discussion of the main findings of this study and their implications for the development of context-based music services for smartphones. © 2015 ACM 2160-6455/2015/09-ART14 $15.00.","Context-aware music recommendation; Mobile application; Music emotion recognition; Music information retrieval; Smartphone","Frequency domain analysis; Mobile devices; Population statistics; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Context annotation; Context based services; Frequency-domain sensor; Mobile applications; Music emotions; Music information retrieval; Music recommendation; Personality traits; Audio acoustics",,,,,,,,"Aharony, N., Pan, W., Ip, C., Khayal, I., Pentland, A., Social fMRI: Investigating and shaping social mechanisms in the real world (2011) Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 7 (6), pp. 643-659; Atallah, L., Yang, G.-Z., The use of pervasive sensing for behaviour profiling-A survey (2009) Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 5 (5), pp. 447-464; Auguita, D., Ghio, A., Oneto, L., Parra, X., Reyes-Ortiz, J.L., Human activity recognition on smartphones using a multiclass hardware-friendly support vector machine (2012) Proceedings of the International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living, pp. 216-223; Baltrunas, L., Best usage context prediction for music tracks (2010) Proceedings of the Workshop on Context Aware Recommender Systems; Baltrunas, L., Kaminskas, M., Ludwig, B., Moling, O., Ricci, F., Aydin, A., Lüke, K.-H., Schwaiger, R., InCarMusic: Context-aware music recommendations in a car (2011) Proceedings of the International Conference on E-commerce and Web Technologies, pp. 89-100; Bradley, M., Lang, P.J., (1999) Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW): Instruction Manual and Affective Ratings, , Technical Report.

We use time contextual information called micro-profiling. Thus, each user has multiple micro profiles, in particular, six-time slots instead of a single profile. The recommendation is performed depended on these micro-profiling. Our method takes into account time intervals in listening music represent user preference in up-to-date. In rating prediction approach, we adopt tendencies-based algorithm, one of the collaborative filtering algorithms, which is very low computational time and memory requirements. From the experimental results, it has shown that the performance of our approach gives more accuracy and low computational time than traditional CF and CF with matrix factorization. © 2015 IEEE.","micro profiling; music recommender system; predictive model; tendencies based algorithm; time contexts","Factorization; Software engineering; Collaborative filtering algorithms; Computational time and memory; Contextual information; micro profiling; Music recommender systems; Predictive algorithms; Predictive modeling; Time contexts; Collaborative filtering",,,,,,,,"Shi, Y., Larson, M., J-Lanjalic, A., Collaborative filtering beyond the User-Item matrix: A survey of the state of the art and future challenges"" (2014) ACM Computing Surveys, 47 (1), pp. 31-345. , April; Marius, K., Ricci, F., Contextual music information retrieval and recommendation:state of the aft and challenges (2012) Computer Science Review, 6, pp. 89-119; Bobadilla, J., Ortega, F., Hcmando, A., Gutierrez, A., Recommender systems survey (2013) Knowledge-Based Systems, 46, pp. 109-132. , July; Candillier, L., Jack, K., Fessant, F., Meyer, F., State-of-the-Art recommender systems (2009) IGI Global; Park, C.H., Kahng, M., Temporal dynamics in music listening behavior: A case study of online music service (2010) The 9th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ACIS 2010), pp. 573-578. , 18-20 August; Darapisut, J., Suksawatchon, J., Comparison of the constant predicrion time of collaborative filtering algorithms by using time contexts (2014) The 11th Intemational Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE 2014, pp. 302-306. , May; Baltrunas, L., Amatriain, X., Towards time-dependant recommendation based on implicit feedback (2009) CARS-2009, , New York, USA October 25; Cacheda, F., Cameiro, V., Fernandez, D., Fonnoso, V., (2011) Comparison of Collaborative Filtering Algorithms: Limitations of Current Techniques and Proposals for Scalable, High-performance Recommender Systems, 5 (2). , February; Taktcs, G., Pilaszy, I., Nemeth, B., Tikk, D., Matrix factorization and neighbor based algorithms for the Netflix prize problem (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, , Lausanne, Switzcriand, October23-25; Shani, G., Gunawardana, A., (2009) Evaluating Recommendation Systems, , Technical report No. MSR-TR-2009-159",,"Duangsuwan J.Vanichayobon S.Preechaveerakul L.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","12th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering, JCSSE 2015","22 July 2015 through 24 July 2015",,114406,,9781479919659,,,"English","Proc.

The tutorial particularly spotlights the question of music similarity, which is an essential aspect in music retrieval and recommendation. Three factors play a central role in MIR research: (1) the music content, i.e., the audio signal itself, (2) the music context, i.e., metadata in the widest sense, and (3) the listeners and their contexts, manifested in user-music interaction traces. We review approaches that extract features from all three data sources and combinations thereof and show how these features can be used for (large-scale) music indexing, music description, music similarity measurement, and recommendation. These methods are further showcased in a number of popular music applications, such as automatic playlist generation and personalized radio stationing, location-aware music recommendation, music search engines, and intelligent browsing interfaces. Additionally, related topics such as music identification, automatic music accompaniment and score following, and search and retrieval in the music production domain are discussed. © 2015 ACM.","Content; Context; Listener; Music information retrieval; Music recommendation","Information retrieval; Search engines; Content; Context; Listener; Music information retrieval; Music recommendation; Audio acoustics",,,,,,,,"Arzt, A., Widmer, G., Towards effective 'any-time' music tracking (2010) Proceedings of the Starting AI Researchers' Symposium (STAIRS), , Lisbon, Portugal; Barrington, L., Turnbull, D., Yazdani, M., Lanckriet, G., Combining audio content and social context for semantic music discovery (2009) Proceedings of the ACM SIGIR, , Boston, MA, USA; Celma, O., Herrera, P., A new approach to evaluating novel recommendations (2008) Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), , New York, NY, USA; Dixon, S., Gouyon, F., Widmer, G., Towards characterisation of music via rhythmic patterns (2004) Proceedings of the International Symposium on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR), , Barcelona, Spain; Downie, J.S., Futrelle, J., Tcheng, D., The international music information retrieval systems evaluation laboratory: Governance, access and security (2004) Proceedings of the International Symposium on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR), , Barcelona, Spain; Dror, G., Koenigstein, N., Koren, Y., Yahoo! music recommendations: Modeling music ratings with temporal dynamics and item taxonomy (2011) Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), , Chicago, IL, USA; Fields, B., Casey, M., Jacobson, K., Sandler, M., Do you sound like your friends?

In this demonstration, we present an intelligent music recommender system, called VenueMusic, to automatically identify suitable music for various popular venues in our daily lives. VenueMusic enjoys a set of nice features: i) music concept sequence generation scheme and Location-aware Topic Model (LTM) are proposed to map the characteristics of venues and music into a latent semantic space, where suitability of music for a venue can be directly measured, ii) a smart interface enabling user to smoothly interact with VenueMusic, and iii) high quality music playlist. The demonstration will show several interesting use-cases of VenueMusic, and illustrate its superiority on recommending music based on where user presents. © 2015 ACM.","Context-aware; Music recommendation; Topic model","Information retrieval; Semantics; Context-Aware; Latent semantics; Music preferences; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; Sequence generation; Smart interface; Topic Modeling; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Cheng, Z., Shen, J., Just-for-me: An adaptive personalization system for location-aware social music recommendation (2014) ACM ICMR; Cheng, Z., Shen, J., On effective location-aware music recommendation (2015) ACM TOIS, , Submitted to; Hallam, S., Cross, I., Thaut, M., (2009) Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology, , Oxford University Press; Shen, J., Pang, H., Wang, M., Yan, S., Modeling concept dynamics for large scale music search (2012) ACM SIGIR",,,"ACM Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (SIGIR)","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2015","9 August 2015 through 13 August 2015",,117001,,9781450336215,,,"English","SIGIR - Proc.

Even though rating prediction is the prevailing paradigm in CFR, there are other issues which have gained significant attention with respect to the content and its variety. Coverage, which constitutes the degree to which recommendations cover the set of available items, is an important factor along with diversity of the items proposed to an individual, often measured by an average dissimilarity between all pairs of recommended items. In this paper, we argue that coverage and diversity cannot be effectively addressed by conventional CFR with pure similaritybased neighborhood creation processes, especially in sparse datasets. Motivated by the need for including wider content characteristics, we propose a novel neighbor selection technique which emphasizes on variety in preferences (to cover polyphony in selection). Our approach consists of a new metric, named ""Exploriometer"", which acts as a personality trait for users based on their rating behavior. We favor users who are explorers in order to increase polyphony, and subsequently coverage and diversity; but we still select similar users when we create neighborhoods as a solid basis in order to keep accuracy levels high. The proposed approach has been experimented by two realworld datasets (MovieLens1 and Yahoo! Music2) with coverage, diversity and accuracy aware recommendations extracted by both traditional CFR and CFR enhanced with our neighborhood creation process. We also introduce a new metric, inspired by the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, to estimate the diversity of recommended items. The derived results demonstrate that our neighbor selection technique can enhance coverage and diversity of the recommendations, especially on sparse datasets.

Even with all the music content available on the web and commercial music streaming services, discovering new music remains a time consuming and taxing activity for the average user. The goal for our proposed system is to provide novel music recommendations based on contextual sensor information. For example, contextual place information can be inferred with intelligent use of techniques such as geo-fencing and using lightweight sensors like accelerometers and com-pass to monitor location. The inspiration behind our system is that music is not in the past, neither in the future, but rather enjoyed in the present. For this reason, the system does not rely on learning the user's listening history. Raw sensor data is fused with information from the web, passed through a cascade of Fuzzy Logic models to infer the user's context, which is then used to recommend music from an online music streaming service (Sound Cloud) after filtering out songs based on genre preferences that the user dislikes. This paper motivates and describes the design for a mobile application along with a description of tests that will be carried out for validation.","Context-aware; Fuzzy logic; Music recommender systems; Sensor data fusion","Data fusion; Fuzzy logic; Information filtering; Location; Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Context-Aware; Mobile applications; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Music recommender systems; Sensor informations; Serendipitous discovery; Traditional approaches; Sensor data fusion",,,,,,,,"Bonnin, G., Jannach, D., Automated generation of music playlists: Survey and experiments (2014) ACM Comput.

Hybrid approaches further incorporate additional sources of information in order to improve the quality of the recommendations. In the context of a music streaming service, we present a hybrid model based on matrix factorization techniques that fuses the implicit feedback derived from the users’ listening activity with the tags that users have given to musical items. In contrast to existing work, we introduce a novel approach to exploit tags by performing a weighted factorization of the tagging activity. We evaluate the model for the task of artist recommendation, using the expected percentile rank as metric, extended with confidence intervals to enable the comparison between models. Thus, our contribution is twofold: (1) we introduce a novel model that uses tags to improve music recommendations and (2) we extend the evaluation methodology to compare the performance of different recommender systems. © Andreu Vall, Marcin Skowron, Peter Knees, Markus Schedl.",,"Collaborative filtering; Factorization; Recommender systems; Collaborative filtering systems; Confidence interval; Evaluation methodologies; Implicit feedback; Matrix factorizations; Music recommendation; Music streaming; Sources of informations; User interfaces",,,,,"Austrian Science Fund, FWF: P25655

Meanwhile, collaborative filtering has the well-known “cold-start” problem, i.e., it is unable to work with new songs that no one has listened to. Efforts on incorporating content information into collaborative filtering methods have shown success in many non-musical applications, such as scientific article recommendation. Inspired by the related work, we train a neural network on semantic tagging information as a content model and use it as a prior in a collaborative filtering model. Such a system still allows the user listening data to “speak for itself”. The proposed system is evaluated on the Million Song Dataset and shows comparably better result than the collaborative filtering approaches, in addition to the favorable performance in the cold-start case. © Dawen Liang, Minshu Zhan, Daniel P.

From the peaceful song for waking up each morning to the traditional song for celebrating a holiday to an up-beat song for enjoying the summer, the relationship between the music and the temporal context is clearly important. For music search and recommendation systems, an understanding of these relationships provides a richer environment to discover and listen. But with the large number of tracks available in music catalogues today, manually labeling track-temporal context associations is difficult, time consuming, and costly. This paper examines track-day contexts with the purpose of identifying relationships with specific music tracks. Improvements are made to an existing method for classifying Christmas tracks and a generalization to the approach is shown that allows automated discovery of music for any day of the year. Analyzing the top 50 tracks obtained from this method for three well-known holidays, Halloween, Saint Patrick’s Day, and July 4th, precision@50 was 95%, 99%, and 73%, respectively. © Cameron Summers, Phillip Popp.",,"Automated discovery; Christmas; Context identification; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Christmas Comes Early to the Echo Nest (The Echo Nest Blog), , http://blog.echonest.com/post/35845347430/christmas-comes-early-to-the-echo-nest; Top 50 Love Songs of All Time (Billboard), , http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/1538839/top-50-love-songs-of-all-time; http://www.last.fm/charts/toptags, Last.fm; Lamere, P., Social tagging and music information retrieval (2008) Journal of New Music Research, 37 (2), pp. 101-114; Reis, B.Y., Pagano, M., Mandl, K.D., Using temporal context to improve biosurveillance (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 100 (4), pp. 1961-1965; Kulkarni, A., Understanding temporal query dynamics (2011) Proceedings of the Fourth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, , ACM; Shokouhi, M., Shokouhi, M., Detecting seasonal queries by time-series analysis (2011) Proceedings of the 34th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, , ACM; Park, C.H., Kahng, M., Temporal dynamics in music listening behavior: A case study of online music service (2010) Computer and Information Science (ICIS), 2010 IEEE/ACIS 9th International Conference on, , IEEE; Carneiro, M.J.T., (2012) Towards The Discovery of Temporal Patterns in Music Listening Using Last.Fm Profiles, , Dissertation; Hidasi, B., Tikk, D., (2013) Context-Aware Recommendations from Implicit Data Via Scalable Tensor Factorization, , arXiv preprint; Summers, C., Popp, P., Large scale discovery of seasonal music with user data (2015) User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization: 23rd International Conference, UMAP 2015, Extended Proceedings, , Springer",,"Muller M.Wiering F.",,"International Society for Music Information Retrieval","16th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, ISMIR 2015","26 October 2015 through 30 October 2015",,149377,,9788460688532,,,"English","Proc.

Previous research has demonstrated that not only does listening to suitable music while driving not impair driving performance, but it could lead to an improved mood and a more relaxed body state, which could improve driving performance and promote safe driving significantly. In this article, we propose SAfeDJ, a smartphone-based situation-aware music recommendation system, which is designed to turn driving into a safe and enjoyable experience. SAfeDJ aims at helping drivers to diminish fatigue and negative emotion. Its design is based on novel interactive methods, which enable in-car smartphones to orchestrate multiple sources of sensing data and the drivers' social context, in collaboration with cloud computing to form a seamless crowdsensing solution. This solution enables different smartphones to collaboratively recommend preferable music to drivers according to each driver's specific situations in an automated and intelligent manner. Practical experiments of SAfeDJ have proved its effectiveness in music-mood analysis, and moodfatigue detections of drivers with reasonable computation and communication overheads on smartphones. Also, our user studies have demonstrated that SAfeDJ helps to decrease fatigue degree and negative mood degree of drivers by 49.09% and 36.35%, respectively, compared to traditional smartphone-based music player under similar driving situations. © 2015 ACM.","Cloud; Context; Crowdsensing; Driving; Music mood; Smartphones","Automobile drivers; Clouds; Signal encoding; Communication overheads; Context; Crowdsensing; Driving; Interactive methods; Music mood; Music mood analysis; Music Recommendation System; Driving performance; Smartphones",,,,,"11&ZD174

We propose several hybrid music recommendation algorithms that combine information on the music content, the music context, and the user context, in particular integrating geospatial notions of similarity. To this end, we use a novel standardized data set of music listening activities inferred from microblogs (MusicMicro) and state-of-the-art techniques to extract audio features and contextual web features. The multimodal recommendation approaches are evaluated for the task of music artist recommendation.

Based on the observation that a user's preferences for particular music pieces change with the contexts she/he faces, this paper proposes an approach to music recommendation that takes the target context into account by exploiting data gathered from a smart device. In addition, the proposed approach improves recommendations by including newly-added music pieces and newly-faced contexts, avoiding repeated recommendations of the same music piece, and reflecting a user's positive and negative feedback over time. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive user study.

This paper presents our research on identifying the time zone where listeners are by analysing their weekly aggregated music listening profiles. We collected a large dataset of full music listening histories (N=594K) of users of the Last.fm's scrobbler service from all around the globe, and formulated six approaches for identifying the time zone where these listening profiles have been generated based on their listeners' behaviour. The performance of these approaches was compared with a manually labelled dataset of listening profiles' time zones. We found that the best method was based on the assumption that people, in general, sleep during night time and submit fewer music logs. This approach, implemented by estimating the local minima of people's weekly aggregated listening profile, resulted in a 75 percent correctly identified time zones with a tolerance of ±1 hour.

As an emerging technology to facilitate effective music retrieval on the move, intelligent recommendation has been recently received great attentions in recent years. While a large amount of efforts have been invested in the field, the technology is still in its infancy. One of the major reasons for this stagnation is due to inability of the existing approaches to comprehensively take multiple kinds of contextual information into account. In the paper, we present a novel recommender system called Just-for-Me to facilitate effective social music recommendation by considering users' location related contexts as well as global music popularity trends. We also develop an unified recommendation model to integrate the contextual factors as well as music contents simultaneously. Furthermore, pseudo-observations are proposed to overcome the cold-start and sparsity problems. An extensive experimental study based on different test collections demonstrates that Just-for-Me system can significantly improve the recommendation performance at various geo-locations.

However, structured experiments on a standardized music dataset to investigate the effects of doing so are scarce. In this paper, we compare performance of various combinations of collaborative filtering and geospatial as well as cultural user models for the task of music recommendation. To this end, we propose a geospatial model that uses GPS coordinates and a cultural model that uses semantic locations (continent, country, and state of the user). We conduct experiments on a novel standardized music collection, the ""Million Musical Tweets Dataset"" of listening events extracted from microblogs. Overall, we find that modeling listeners' location via Gaussian mixture models and computing similarities from these outperforms both cultural user models and collaborative filtering.

In recent years, research on contextual music recommendation has emerged and new services have been introduced. Driving is one of the most common listening situations. It differs from other listening situations in that the main focus is on driving, which means the mental load is higher. The scenario of listening to music while driving has been neglected in past research and is therefore reflected by the limited integration of textual music adaptation in car radios or infotainment systems. This paper presents the results of a preliminary study involving a driving simulator created to analyze the effects of various types of music on subjects while driving. As the results of the subjective measure show, there is a strong influence on the mental load of participants listening to fast-paced music while driving. According to these findings, a first prototype of an application was implemented allowing the driver to adjust the music selection with respect to the mental load as well as personal preference. This application uses contextual parameters and performs as a research prototype for future real-driving studies. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","context-awareness; driving context; mental load; Music recommendation","Design; Mobile devices; Context-awareness; driving context; Driving simulator; Infotainment systems; Mental loads; Music recommendation; Personal preferences; Research prototype; Research",,,,,,,,"Jonsson, K., Holmström, J., Lyytinen, K., Nilsson, A., Desituating context in ubiquitous computing: Exploring strategies for the use of remote diagnostic systems for maintenance work (2010) International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation, 2, pp. 40-55; Kaminskas, M., Ricci, F., Contextual music information retrieval and recommendation: State of the art and challenges (2012) Computer Science Review, 6, pp. 89-119; North, A., Hargreaves, D., Hargreaves, J., Uses of Music in Everyday Life (2004) Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 22; Wang, X., Wang, Y., Rosenblum, D., A daily, activity-aware, mobile music recommender system (2012) Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 1313-1314. , ACM, New York; North, A.C., Hargreaves, D.J., Situational influences on reported musical preference (1996) Psychomusicology: A Journal of Research in Music Cognition, 15, pp. 30-45; Dibben, N., Williamson, V.J., An exploratory survey of in-vehicle music listening (2007) Psychology of Music, pp. 571-589; Stutts, J., Feaganes, J., Reinfurt, D., Rodgman, E., Hamlett, C., Gish, K., Staplin, L., Driver's exposure to distractions in their natural driving environment (2005) Accid.

By out-of-context we mean that a user wants to receive recommendation on, say, musicians to follow even though the user's tweets' contents and social links have no connection to the ""context"" of music. In this setting, where a user has never expressed interest in the context of music, many existing methods fail. Our approach exploits co-following information and hidden correlations where, say, a user's political preference might actually provide clues about their likely music preference. For example, a user u might be recommended a particular music band b because u also follows a set of politicians P, and other users who follow members of P tend to follow b, rather than an alternative b′. We implement this framework in two very distinct settings: one for recommending musicians and one for recommending political parties in Tunisia. Our framework is simple and similar to Amazon's ""users who bought X also bought Y"" and can be used not only for explainable out-of-context recommendations but also for social studies on, say, which music is ""closest"" to users of a particular political affiliation. It also helps to introduce and to ""link"" a user to an unknown domain, say, politics in Tunisia. Copyright © 2014, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Unlike approaches that rely on music content and have been researched for almost two decades, music-contextbased (or contextual) approaches to music retrieval are a quite recent field of research within music information retrieval (MIR). Contextual data refers to all music-relevant information that is not included in the audio signal itself. In this article, we focus on contextual aspects of music primarily accessible through web technology. We discuss different sources of context-based data for individual music pieces and for music artists. We summarize various approaches for constructing similarity measures based on the collaborative or cultural knowledge incorporated into these data sources. In particular, we identify and review three main types of context-based similarity approaches: text-retrieval-based approaches (relying on web-texts, tags, or lyrics), cooccurrence-based approaches (relying on playlists, page counts, microblogs, or peer-to-peer-networks), and approaches based on user ratings or listening habits. This article elaborates the characteristics of the presented context-based measures and discusses their strengths as well as their weaknesses. © 2013 ACM.","Music context; Music information retrieval; Music recommendation; Music similarity; Survey","Context-based similarity; Cultural knowledge; Music context; Music information retrieval; Music recommendation; Music similarity; Similarity measure; Web technologies; Distributed computer systems; Information retrieval; Peer to peer networks; Surveying; Surveys",,,,,,,,"Aizenberg, N., Koren, Y., Somekh, O., Build your own music recommender by modeling internet radio streams (2012) Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 1-10. , ACM, New York; Aucouturier, J.-J., Pachet, F., Scaling up music playlist generation (2002) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME'02), pp. 105-108; Aucouturier, J.-J., Pachet, F., Roy, P., Beurivé, A., Signal + context = better classification (2007) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR'07); Aucouturier, J.-J., Pachet, F., Sandler, M., ""The way it sounds"": Timbre models for analysis and retrieval of music signals (2005) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 7 (6), pp. 1028-1035. , DOI 10.1109/TMM.2005.858380; Baccigalupo, C., Plaza, E., Donaldson, J., Uncovering affinity of artists to multiple genres from social behaviour data (2008) Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR'08); Barrington, L., Turnbull, D., Yazdani, M., Lanckriet, G., Combining audio content and social context for semantic music discovery (2009) Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGIR; Baumann, S., Hummel, O., Using cultural metadata for artist recommendation (2003) Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Web Delivering of Music (WEDELMUSIC'03); Bell, R.M., Koren, Y., Lessons from the Netflix prize challenge (2007) SIGKDD Explorat, 9 (2), pp. 75-79; Berenzweig, A., Logan, B., Ellis, D.P., Whitman, B., A large-scale evaluation of acoustic and subjective music similarity measures (2003) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR'03); Brill, E., A simple rule-based part of speech tagger (1992) Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing, pp. 152-155; Brochu, E., De Freitas, N., Bao, K., The sound of an album cover: Probabilistic multimedia and IR (2003) Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics; Cano, P., Koppenberger, M., The emergence of complex network patterns in music artist networks (2004) Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR'04), pp. 466-469; Casey, M.A., Veltkamp, R., Goto, M., Leman, M., Rhodes, C., Slaney, M., Content-based music information retrieval: Current directions and future challenges (2008) Proc.

The former refers to features derived from the audio signal; the second refers to aspects of the music or artist not encoded in the audio, nevertheless important to human music perception; the third refers to contextual aspects of the user which change dynamically. In this paper, we briefly review the well-researched categories of music content and music context features, before focusing on user-centric models, which have been neglected for a long time in music retrieval and recommendation approaches. In particular, we address the following tasks: (i) geospatial music recommendation from microblog data, (ii) user-aware music playlist generation on smart phones, and (iii) matching places of interest and music. The approaches presented for task (i) rely on large-scale data inferred from microblogs, motivated by the fact that social media represent an unprecedented source of information about every topic of our daily lives. Information about music items and artists is thus found in abundance in user-generated data. The questions of how to infer information relevant to music recommendation from microblogs and what to learn from them are discussed. So are different ways of incorporating this kind of information into state-of-the-art music recommendation algorithms. The presented approaches targeted at tasks (ii) and (iii) model the user in a more comprehensive way than just using information about her location and music listening habits. We report results of a user study aiming at investigating the relationship between music listening activity and a large set of contextual user features. Based on these, an intelligent mobile music player that automatically adapts the current playlist to the user context is presented. Eventually, we discuss different methods to solve task (iii), i.e., to determine music that suits a given place of interest, for instance, a major monument. In particular, we look into knowledge-based and tag-based methods to match music and places. © 2013 ACM.","adaptive playlist generation; hybrid music recommendation; mobile music player; user-centric music retrieval","adaptive playlist generation;

We present a study of the effects of these social explanations in a music recommendation context. We start with an experiment with 237 users, in which we show explanations with varying levels of social information and analyze their effect on users' decisions. We distinguish between two key decisions: the likelihood of checking out the recommended artist, and the actual rating of the artist based on listening to several songs. We find that while the explanations do have some inuence on the likelihood, there is little correlation between the likelihood and actual (listening) rating for the same artist. Based on these insights, we present a generative probabilistic model that ex-plains the interplay between explanations and background information on music preferences, and how that leads to a final likelihood rating for an artist. Acknowledging the impact of explanations, we discuss a general recommendation framework that models external informational elements in the recommendation interface, in addition to inherent preferences of users.

This problem is well studied in different contexts such as item, document, music and movie recommendations. For the purpose of recommendation these systems store the context or the meta-data information about the item of interest (e.g. user rating for books, tags, price etc). However, the general approaches for finding relevant items for recommendation cannot be directly applied in the case when the context or meta-data information about the item of interest is missing. In this paper we describe an algorithmic approach to handle this problem of missing context for items. In the proposed approach we have extended the context of user's interest and developed an unsupervised algorithm to find the items of interest for the user. Finally the items are ranked based on their relevance to the user's interest. We study this problem in the domain of dataset recommendation where the meta-data information about the datasets is missing due to lack of coherent and complete repository for the research datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with real world dataset consisting of 20 user queries. We find that the proposed framework can recommend datasets for user queries with a recall of 90% in the top-4 recommendations. We also compared the performance of the dataset finding algorithm with the state of art supervised classification approach.

We introduce the idea of similarity, which has been widely studied in the filed of information retrieval, and incorporate multiple feature similarities into the FM framework, including content-based and context-based similarities. The similarity information not only captures the similar patterns from the referred objects, but enhances the convergence speed and accuracy of FM. In addition, in order to avoid the noise within large similarity of features, we also adopt the grouping FM as an extended method to model the problem. In our experiments, a music-recommendation dataset is used to assess the performance of the proposed approach. The datasets is collected from an online blogging website, which includes user listening history, user profiles, social information, and music information. Our experimental results show that, with various types of feature similarities the performance of music recommendation can be enhanced significantly. Furthermore, via the grouping technique, the performance can be improved significantly in terms of Mean Average Precision, compared to the traditional collaborative filtering approach. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Context-based similarity; Convergence speed; Factorization machines; Feature similarities; Grouping technique; Music recommendation; Similarity informations; Social information",,,,,,,,"Yang, Y.-H., Liu, J.-Y., Quantitative study of music listening behavior in a social and affective context (2013) IEEE Trans.

Typically, they work by analyzing the past user-song relationships, and provide informed guesses based on the overall information collected from other users. Although the music listening behavior is a repetitive and time-dependent process, these methods have not taken this into account and only consider user-song interaction for recommendation. In this work, we explore the usage of temporal context and session diversity in Session-based Collaborative Filtering techniques for music recommendation. We compared two techniques to capture the users' listening patterns over time: one explicitly extracts temporal properties and session diversity, to group and compare the similarity of sessions, the other uses a generative topic modeling algorithm, which is able to implicitly model temporal patterns. We evaluated the developed algorithms by measuring the Hit Ratio, and the Mean Reciprocal Rank. Results reveal that the inclusion of temporal information, either explicitly or implicitly, increases significantly the accuracy of the recommendation, while compared to the traditional session-based CF. © 2013 IEEE.","Collaborative Filtering; Listening Sessions; Music Recommendation; Temporal Context","Collaborative filtering methods; Collaborative filtering techniques; Listening Sessions; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Temporal Context; Time-dependent process; Topic modeling algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Collaborative filtering; Tools; Algorithms",,,,,,,,"Schwartz, B., (2005) The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less, , Harper Perennial; Celma, O., (2010) Music Recommendation and Discovery, , Springer; Herrera, P., Rocking around the clock eight days a week: An exploration of temporal patterns of music listening (2010) WOMRAD; Lee, J., Music for my mood: A music recommendation system based on context reasoning (2006) Smart Sensing and Context; Liu, N., Lai, S., Chen, C., Adaptive music recommendation based on user behavior in time slot (2009) JCSNS; Hansen, D., Golbeck, J., M ixing it up: Recommending collections of items (2009) Proc. of CHI; Park, S.E., Lee, S., Lee, S.-G., Session-based collaborative filtering for predicting the next song (2011) Proc. of CNSI; Zheleva, E., Guiver, J., Mendes Rodrigues, E., Milic-Frayling, N., Statistical models of music-listening sessions in social media (2010) Proc. of World Wide Web; Lee, D., Park, S.E., Kahng, M., Lee, S., Lee, S.-G., Exploiting contextual information from event logs for personalized recommendation (2010) Computer and Information Science, pp. 121-139; Konstan, J.A., Miller, B.N., Maltz, D., Herlocker, J.L., Gordon, L.R., Riedl, J., Volume, H., Grouplens: Applying collaborative filtering to usenet news (1997) Communications of the ACM, 40, pp. 77-87; Abowd, G.D., Dey, A.K., Brown, P.J., Davies, N., Smith, M., Steggles, P., Towards a better understanding of context and contextawareness (1999) Ser.

Current texts in music therapy identify the importance of this critical and user-oriented perspective, but the relevance and implications for music therapy need to be outlined. Objective: This study explores service users' experiences of music therapy in mental health care, and the potential role of music therapy in the development of recovery-oriented service provision. Methods: We conducted a qualitative meta-synthesis of studies examining service users' experiences in music therapy; included were 14 studies with a total of 113 participants. Both first-hand account of participants and the researchers' representations of such statements were taken into account in the analysis. Findings: A taxonomy of four areas of users' experiences was identified: ""having a good time;"" ""being together;"" ""feeling;""and ""being someone.""These core categories point towards music therapy as an arena that can be used by persons with mental health problems in their personal and social recovery process. Music therapy can contribute to the quality of mental health care by providing an arena for stimulation and development of strengths and resources that may contribute to growth of positive identity and hope for people with mental illness. Conclusions: The findings from this meta-synthesis indicate that the provision of music therapy closely resembles recognized benefits of a recovery-oriented practice. Awareness of users' self-determination and the development of a strength-based and contextual approach to music therapy that fosters mutual empowering relationships are recommended © 2013 by the American Music Therapy Association.",,"human; Mental Disorders; mental health service; meta analysis; music therapy; patient satisfaction; procedures; standards; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Music Therapy; Patient Satisfaction",,,,,"Lovisenberg Diakonale Sykehus, LDS

The idea is to recommend information that would be of interest to a user according to the user's surround context. Although remarkable progress has been made, relatively little research has been made to contextualize music playback based on a large-scale dataset of real-life listening records. This paper presents our recent endeavor in collecting 5,502 real-life listening records with context annotation using Android smartphones in-situ. The user-provided context annotation contains labels selected from 10 user activity categories and 10 user mood categories. Moreover, we also compute a rich set of sensor features to capture the context at which the users listen to music, encompassing location, time, acceleration, proximity, etc. Our evaluation shows that with such context information we are able to significantly improve the performance of music recommendation, using factorization machine as the recommendation engine. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Context annotation; Context information; Context-Aware; Context-based; Factorization machines; Large-scale dataset; Music recommendation; User activity; Data processing; Exhibitions; Mobile devices; Sensors; Smartphones",,,,,,,,"Roggen, D., Magnenat, S., Waibel, M., Troster, G., Wearable computing: Designing and sharing activity-recognition systems across platforms (2011) IEEE Robotics &Automation Magazine, pp. 83-95; Kaminskas, M., Ricci, F., Contextual music information retrieval and recommendation: State of the art and challenges (2012) Computer Science Review, 6 (2), pp. 89-119; Ricci, F., Context-Aware music recommender systems (2012) Int.

The suggested hybrid approach combines two techniques - one based on representing both POIs and music with tags, and the other based on the knowledge of the semantic relations between the two types of items. We show that our approach can be scaled up using a novel music auto-tagging technique and we compare it in a live user study to: two non-hybrid solutions, either based on tags or on semantic relations; and to a context-free but personalized recommendation approach. In the considered scenario, i.e., a situation defined by a context (the POI), we show that personalization (via music preference) is not sufficient and it is important to implement effective adaptation techniques to the user's context. In fact, we show that the users are more satisfied with the recommendations generated by combining the tag-based and knowledge-based context adaptation techniques, which exploit orthogonal types of relations between places and music tracks. © 2013 ACM.","Auto-tagging; Context-aware recommendation; Hybrid recommendation; Music recommendation; Tag prediction","Adaptation techniques; Auto-tagging; Context adaptation; Context-aware recommendations; Hybrid recommendation; Music recommendation; Personalized recommendation; Semantic relations; Knowledge based systems; Recommender systems; Semantics; User interfaces",,,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Mobasher, B., Ricci, F., Tuzhilin, A., Context-aware recommender systems (2011) AI Magazine, 32 (3), pp. 67-80; Ankolekar, A., Sandholm, T., Foxtrot: A soundtrack for where you are (2011) Proceedings of Interacting with Sound Workshop: Exploring Context-Aware, Local and Social Audio Applications, pp. 26-31; Aucouturier, J.-J., Pachet, F., Improving timbre similarity: How high is the sky?

We analyze the association between user-generated text and music by using a real-world dataset with <user, text, music> tripartite information collected from the social blogging website LiveJournal. The audio information represents various perceptual dimensions of music listening, including danceability, loudness, mode, and tempo; the emotional text information consists of bag-of-words and three dimensional affective states within an article: valence, arousal and dominance. To combine these factors for music recommendation, a factorization machine- based approach is taken. Our evaluation shows that the emotional context information mined from user-generated articles does improve the quality of recommendation, com- paring to either the collaborative filtering approach or the content-based approach.

The students of music schools are a unique group of children and youths, because of specific loads on the organs of locomotion, associated with the playing of musical instruments. They can therefore be exposed to a variety of health problems, particularly in the case of insufficient physical activity. Objective: The aim of the presented study was to assess the level of physical activity of music schools' students on weekdays and weekends against the parameters of physical efforts beneficial to health. Method and materials: The study involved 225 musicians from the Katowice School of Music, Complex of I and II degrees, aged 10-18 years(138 girls and 87 boys). The level of physical activity was assessed on the basis of moderate to vigorous rates (MVPA). Results: Both on weekdays as well as at the weekends, boys presented a higher level of physical activity of at least moderate intensity (MVPA), which also resulted in a greater total weekly pro-health physical activity. Both boys and girls dedicated significantly more time to beneficial pro-health efforts physical health at weekends (p<0.01). The percentage of young musicians who meet accepted (in this study) standards for the optimal amount of physical activity in both groups was dramatically low (3.6% of girls and 11.5% of boys). Conclusion: Both boys and girls from the music schools often undertake moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at the weekends. The boys more often than the girls made pro-health physical efforts of moderate and high intensity.","Children; Instrumentalists; Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA); Physical activity; Recommendations","adolescent; adult; article; child; energy expenditure; female; human; male; music; musician; physical activity; physical parameters; public health; school; school child; self evaluation; student; Adolescent; Child; Exercise; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Motor Activity; Music; Poland; Public Health; Students; Time Factors",,,,,,,,"Schnohr, P., Lange, P., Scharling, H., Jensen, J.S., Long-term physical activity in leisure time and mortality from coronary heart disease, stroke, respiratory diseases, and cancer (2006) The Copenhagen City Heart Study.

Using state-of-the-art techniques to extract audio features and contextual web features, and a novel standardized data set of music listening activities inferred from microblogs (MusicMicro), we propose several multimodal retrieval functions.

As data grows and recommendation requests must be answered in a split second, online and agile solutions must be implemented.

One of the most challenging studies involves implementing a situation-aware personalized music recommendation service which considers the user's situation and preferences. Situation-aware music recommendation requires multidisciplinary efforts including low-level feature extraction and analysis, music mood classification and human emotion prediction. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for a situation-aware/user-adaptive music recommendation service in the semantic web environment. To do this, we first discuss utilizing knowledge for analyzing and retrieving music contents semantically, and a user adaptive music recommendation scheme based on semantic web technologies that facilitates the development of domain knowledge and a rule set. Based on this discussion, we describe our Context-based Music Recommendation (COMUS) ontology for modeling the user's musical preferences and contexts, and supporting reasoning about the user's desired emotions and preferences. Basically, COMUS defines an upper music ontology that captures concepts on the general properties of music such as titles, artists and genres. In addition, it provides functionality for adding domain-specific ontologies, such as music features, moods and situations, in a hierarchical manner, for extensibility. Using this context ontology, we believe that logical reasoning rules can be inferred based on high-level (implicit) knowledge such as situations from low-level (explicit) knowledge. As an innovation, our ontology can express detailed and complicated relations among music clips, moods and situations, which enables users to find appropriate music. We present some of the experiments we performed as a casestudy for music recommendation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Customization; Ontology; Reasoning; Semantic web; User profiles","Computer music; Ontology; Web services; Customization; Domain-specific ontologies; Low-level features; Music recommendation; Realtime multimedia; Reasoning; Semantic Web technology; User profile; Semantic Web",,,,,"Ministry of Knowledge Economy, MKE: NIPA-2011-C1090-1101-0008","Acknowledgment “This research was supported by the MKE(Ministry of Knowledge Economy), Korea, under the ITRC(Information Technology Research Center) support program supervised by the NIPA (National IT Industry Promotion Agency)” (NIPA-2011-C1090-1101-0008)",,"All Music Guide, , http://allmusic.com; Birmingham, W., Dannenberg, R., Pardo, B., An introduction to query by humming with the vocal search system (2006) Commun ACM, 49 (8), pp. 49-52; Cano, P., Content-based music audio recommendation (2005) Proc of ACM Multimedia, pp. 211-212; CYC Upper Ontology, , http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/vocab/vocab-toc.html; Ellis, D.P.W., Poliner, G.E., Identifying 'Cover songs' with chroma features and dynamic programming beat tracking (2007) IEEE Conf Acoustic Speech Signal Process ICASSP IV1429-1432; http://www.garageband.com/; Grüninger, M., Fox, M.S., The role of mariano fernández lópez 4-12 competency questions in enterprise engineering (1994) IFIP WG 5.7 Workshop on Benchmarking.

In recent years, a new research area of contextual music recommendation and retrieval has emerged. Context-aware music recommender systems are capable of suggesting music items taking into consideration contextual conditions, such as the user’s mood or location, that may influence the user’s preferences at a particular moment. In this work, we consider a particular kind of context-aware recommendation task—selecting music content that fits a place of interest (POI). To address this problem we have used emotional tags assigned to both music tracks and POIs, and we have considered a set of similarity metrics for tagged resources to establish a match between music tracks and POIs. Following an initial web-based evaluation of the core matching technique, we have developed a mobile application that suggests an itinerary and plays recommended music for each visited POI, and evaluated it in a live user study. The results of the study show that users judge the recommended music as suited for the POIs, and that the music is rated higher when it is played in this usage scenario. © 2012, Springer-Verlag London.","Affective computing; Location-aware services; Mobile services; Music recommender systems; Social tagging",,,,,,,,,"Abel, F., Herder, E., Houben, G.J., Henze, N., Krause, D., Cross-system user modeling and personalization on the social web.

Nowadays, most people consume music on their personal computers and mobile devices via Internet. Web sites and online services now typically contain millions of music tracks, which complicate search, retrieval and discovery of music. Music recommender systems can address these issues by recommending relevant and novel music to a user based on personal musical tastes. A typical scenario in music recommendation is that the music consumption is focused on some popular tracks and the most unpopular tracks are rarely accessed (i.e., the Long Tail problem). In this paper, we evaluate the impact of using context-aware recommender systems to recommend music in the Long Tail. We perform a set of experiments by applying three different context-aware recommender systems on three different real world data sets. Our findings show that by using contextual information we can improve music recommendation in the Long Tail scenario. © 2013 IEEE.","Context; Long Tail; Music Recommendation","Intelligent systems; Mobile devices; Personal computers; Context; Context-aware recommender systems; Contextual information; Long tail; Music recommendation; Music recommender systems; On-line service; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Ruppert, P., Hart, R., Evans, S., (2007) The 2007 Digital Music Survey, Entertainment Media Research, , http://www.slideshare.net/patsch/emr-digital-music-survey-2007; Celma, O., (2010) Music Recommendation and Discovery - The Long Tail, Long Fail, and Long Play in the Digital Music Space, , Springer; Breese, J.S., Heckerman, D., Kadie, C.M., Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering (1998) Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 43-52; Barrington, L., Oda, R., Lanckriet, G., Smarter than genius?

However, making such use of mobile context, while learning user profiles, is a challenging problem. This case study presents a system for collecting context and usage data from mobile devices, but targeted at recommending music via unsupervised learning of user profiles and relevant situations. The developed data flow system supports both short enough response times and longer asynchronous reasoning on the collected data; furthermore, the mobile phone acts not only as sensor, but the mobile app is directly tied to the effectiveness of the music service user experience (UX).

Most music programs have their own moods or atmospheres, depending on broadcasting time, target listeners, and program purpose. Essentially, a significant portion of this atmosphere depends on the music playlist of the program. This indicates that each radio program has some consistent tendency or trend in its music selection. In this paper, we propose a music radio program cloning technique, called SmartRadio based on various musical features and context information for music recommendations of the same quality as real radio programs. We implemented a prototype SmartRadio system and showed that SmartRadio can produce satisfactory results through our experiments.","Music feature extraction; Music station; Signal processing",,,,,,,,,"http://www.pandora.com; http://www.mufin.com; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Genome_Project; Cano, P., Content-based music audio recommendation (2005) Proceedings of the 13th Annual ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 211-212. , New York, NY, USA; Pauws, S., PATS: Realization and user evaluation of an automatic playlist generator (2002) International Symposium on Music Information Retrieval, pp. 222-230; Han, B., Music emotion classification and context-based music recommendation (2009) Multimed.

The goal of a context-aware recommender system is to adapt its recommendations not just to the general preferences of users, but also to the context in which users are seeking those rec- ommendations. In the domain of music recommendation, the explicit contextual factors and their values might not be known to the system, a priori. Moreover, the contextual state of a user can be dynamic and change during an inter- action with the system. In this paper, we present a hybrid context-aware recommender system which infers contextual information from the sequence of songs listened to or specified by a user and uses this information to produce context- aware recommendations. Our system mines popular tags for songs from social media Web sites and uses a topic modeling approach to learn latent topics representing various contexts. We then model each song as a set of latent topics capturing the general characteristics of that song. This representation is used to track and detect changes in user's choice of mu- sic, as reffected in a playlist of song sequence, and adjust the recommendations to better meet the current context of the user. Using our approach, the contextual information can be integrated with any traditional recommendation al- gorithm to produce context-aware recommendations. For our system, we designed and evaluated two hybrid meth- ods. The first hybrid combines collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation techniques, and the second hybrid additionally incorporates information about pairwise song associations. Our evaluation results show that both the hybrid approach and the contextualization can enhance the performance of baseline music recommendation method.

We introduce a new wearable sensing platform, Septimu, which consists of a pair of sensor-equipped earphones that communicate to the smartphone via the audio jack. The Septimu platform enables the MusicalHeart application to continuously monitor the heart rate and activity level of the user while listening to music. The physiological information and contextual information are then sent to a remote server, which provides dynamic music suggestions to help the user maintain a target heart rate. We provide empirical evidence that the measured heart rate is 75%-85% correlated to the ground truth with an average error of 7:5 BPM. The accuracy of the person-specific, 3-class activity level detector is on average 96:8%, where these activity levels are separated based on their differing impacts on heart rate. We demonstrate the practicality of MusicalHeart by deploying it in two real world scenarios and show that MusicalHeart helps the user achieve a desired heart rate intensity with an average error of less than 12:2%, and its quality of recommendation improves over time.

Although first steps towards such systems have recently been presented at ISMIR and similar venues, this vision is still far away from being a reality. In this paper, we investigate and discuss literature on the topic of user-centric music retrieval and reflect on why the breakthrough in this field has not been achieved yet. Given the different expertises of the authors, we shed light on why this topic is a particularly challenging one, taking a psychological and a computer science view. Whereas the psychological point of view is mainly concerned with proper experimental design, the computer science aspect centers on modeling and machine learning problems. We further present our ideas on aspects vital to consider when elaborating user-aware music retrieval systems, and we also describe promising evaluation methodologies, since accurately evaluating personalized systems is a notably challenging task. © 2012 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.",,"Context-Aware; Evaluation methodologies; Machine learning problem; Music information retrieval; Music retrieval; Music retrieval systems; Recommendation algorithms; User-centric; Computer science; Information retrieval",,,,,,,,"Aucouturier, J.-J., Pachet, F., Representing musical genre: A state of the art (2003) Journal of New Music Research, 32 (1), pp. 83-93; Baltrunas, L., Kaminskas, M., Ludwig, B., Moling, O., Ricci, F., Lüke, K.-H., Schwaiger, R., InCarMusic: Context-aware music recommendations in a car (2011) Proc.

In the implemented prototype, the user interacts with a collection of pictures to receive new music recommendations from associated genres. The prototype was evaluated by 40 Finnish participants. After the first use of the prototype, the concept of selecting music based on mood pictures was found to be very good by 85% of the participants. In the longer-term use, the prototype lacked some important features such as the ability to personalize the picture and music associations. Despite this, 60% of the participants were interested in using the prototype to complement their other music player applications. This indicates that mood pictures are a promising way to access music collections and to explore new music. © 2012 IEEE.","design; emotion; Mood; music recommendation system; musical genre; picture; playlist; SuperMusic; user experience; user interface","emotion; Mood; Music Recommendation System; Musical genre; picture; playlist; SuperMusic; User experience; Design; Visualization; User interfaces",,,,,,,,"All Music Guide, , http://www.allmusic.com, accessed August 9, 2011; Dey, A.K., Abowd, G.D., (1999) Towards A Better Understanding of Context and Context-Awareness, , Tech.

Although it is hard to capture these factors directly, it is possible to see their effects on the sequence of songs liked by the user in his/her current interaction with the system. In this paper, we present a context-aware music recommender system which infers contextual information based on the most recent sequence of songs liked by the user. Our approach mines the top frequent tags for songs from social tagging Web sites and uses topic modeling to determine a set of latent topics for each song, representing different contexts. Using a database of human-compiled playlists, each playlist is mapped into a sequence of topics and frequent sequential patterns are discov- ered among these topics. These patterns represent frequent sequences of transitions between the latent topics representing contexts. Given a sequence of songs in a user's current interaction, the discovered patterns are used to predict the next topic in the playlist. The predicted topics are then used to postfilter the initial ranking produced by a traditional recommendation algorithm. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a conventional recommender system based on collaborative or content-based filtering. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach proposed here is also useful in providing better insight into the underlying reasons for song selection and in applications such as playlist construction and context prediction.

We selected low-level musical features which may trigger human emotions, based on TV music program's audience rating information and the corresponding music. In this program, audience was requested to rate music of the contestants and to select their preferred music based on their emotional feelings. In addition, we implemented personalized music recommendation system using selected features, context information and listening history.

Manaus - AM, Brazil","As mobile devices are always with users and music listening is a very personal and situational behaviour, contextual information could be used to greatly enhance music recommendations. However, making such use of context, while learning user profiles, is still a challenging problem. We present a system for collecting context and usage data from mobile devices, but targeted at recommending music according to learned user profiles and specific situations. The developed data flow system requires supporting both short enough response times and longer asynchronous reasoning on the collected data. Furthermore, the mobile phone acts not only as sensor, but is directly related to the effectiveness of the music service experience. Thus, this paper provides a description of our approach to the system and the initial results of a usability test of the mobile application and its backend system. © 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","context-aware systems; data flow; Music; recommender systems","Artificial intelligence; Data transfer; Mobile devices; Recommender systems; User interfaces; Context-aware systems; Contextual information; Data flow; Learning user profiles; Mobile applications; Music; Music recommendation; Service experience; Cellular telephone systems",,,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions (2005) IEEE Trans.

In this paper we consider a particular kind of context-aware recommendation task: selecting music suited for a place of interest (POI), which the user is visiting, and that is illustrated in a mobile travel guide. We have designed an approach for this novel recommendation task by matching music to POIs using emotional tags. In order to test our approach, we have developed a mobile application that suggests an itinerary and plays recommended music for each visited POI. The results of the study show that users judge the recommended music suited for the POIs, and the music is rated higher when it is played in this usage scenario. © 2011 ACM.","context awareness; mobile services; music recommender systems; tags","Context- awareness; Context-Aware; Mobile applications; Mobile service; Music recommender systems; tags; Usage scenarios; User interfaces; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Cai, R., Zhang, C., Wang, C., Zhang, L., Ma, W.-Y., Musicsense: Contextual music recommendation using emotional allocation modeling (2007) Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 553-556. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Hoashi, K., Matsumoto, K., Inoue, N., Personalization of user profiles for content-based music retrieval based on relevance feedback (2003) Proceedings of the 11th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 110-119. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Kaminskas, M., Ricci, F., Location-adapted music recommendation using tags (2011) UMAP 2011-19th International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization; Kim, J.Y., Belkin, N.J., Categories of music description and search terms and phrases used by non-music experts Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Music Information Retrieval, Paris, France, 2002; Konstas, I., Stathopoulos, V., Jose, J.M., On social networks and collaborative recommendation (2009) Proceedings of the 32nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 195-202. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Lee, J., Lee, J., Context awareness by case-based reasoning in a music recommendation system (2007) Ubiquitous Computing Systems, pp. 45-58. , Springer; Lewis, J., IBM Computer Usability Satisfaction Questionnaires: Psychometric Evaluation and Instructions for Use (1995) International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 7 (1), pp. 57-78; Markines, B., Cattuto, C., Menczer, F., Benz, D., Hotho, A., Stumme, G., Evaluating similarity measures for emergent semantics of social tagging (2009) Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 641-650. , ACM; Zentner, M., Grandjean, D., Scherer, K.R., Emotions evoked by the sound of music: Characterization, classification, and measurement (2008) Emotion, 8 (4), pp. 494-521. , August","Braunhofer, M.; Free University of Bolzano, Piazza Domenicani 3, Bolzano, Italy; email: mbraunhofer@unibz.it",,"ACM SIGCHI",,"5th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, RecSys 2011","23 October 2011 through 27 October 2011","Chicago, IL",87514,,9781450306836,,,"English","RecSys - Proc.

Given the current scenario, and under a situation where just implicit user feedback is available, it would be more appropriate either to provide recommendations using the implicit data and implicit fedback-based methods, or to map implicit user feedback to explicit feedback and then use an explicit based algorithm?

In this paper we consider a particular kind of context aware recommendation task - selecting music content that fits a place of interest (POI). To address this problem we have used emotional tags attached by a users' population to both music and POIs. Moreover, we have considered a set of similarity metrics for tagged resources to establish a match between music tracks and POIs. In order to test our hypothesis, i.e., that the users will reckon that a music track suits a POI when this track is selected by our approach, we have designed a live user experiment where subjects are repeatedly presented with POIs and a selection of music tracks, some of them matching the presented POI and some not. The results of the experiment show that there is a strong overlap between the users' selections and the best matching music that is recommended by the system for a POI. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","context; emotions; location-aware; music; recommender systems; social tagging","context; emotions; location-aware; music; Social tagging; Experiments; Mathematical models; Recommender systems; Computer music",,,,,,,,"Baccigalupo, C., Plaza, E., Case-based sequential ordering of songs for playlist recommendation (2006) LNCS (LNAI), 4106, pp. 286-300. , Roth-Berghofer, T.R., Göker, M.H., Güvenir, H.A.

So, for instance, music recommendations while the user is traveling by car should take into account the current traffic condition or the driver's mood. This requires the acquisition of ratings for items in several alternative contextual situations, to extract from this data the true dependency of the ratings on the contextual situation. In this paper, in order to simplify the in-context rating acquisition process, we consider the individual perceptions of the users about the influence of context on their decisions. We have elaborated a system design methodology where we assume that users can be requested to judge: a) if a contextual factor (e.g., the traffic state) is relevant for their decision making task, and b) how they would rate an item assuming that a certain contextual condition (e.g., traffic is chaotic) holds. Using these evaluations we show that it is possible to build an effective context-aware mobile recommender system. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,"Electronic commerce; Recommender systems; Systems analysis; Acquisition process; Context-Aware; Context-aware recommender systems; Contextual factors; Music recommendation; Traffic conditions; Traffic state; User interfaces",,,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Context-aware recommender systems (2011) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 217-256. , Ricci, F., Rokach, L., Shapira, B., Kantor, P.

Emphasis is placed upon career development. Standardized open-ended interviews were used to obtain rich and in-depth descriptions of the participants' experiences. Ten music therapists from six countries participated in the study. The themes that emerged from the data include moving from the ideal to the real world, shifting from the role of student to professional, confronting reality and working through challenges, and achieving personal growth and self-transformation. The dynamics of cross-cultural comparison, confronting the home culture, and redefining music therapy and professional identities within the local cultural context are illustrated via quotations from the participants.

We first introduce three novel block-level features - the Variance Delta Spectral Pattern (VDSP), the Correlation Pattern (CP) and the Spectral Contrast Pattern (SCP). Then we describe how to combine the extracted features into a single similarity function. A comprehensive evaluation based on genre classification experiments shows that the combined block-level similarity measure (BLS) is comparable, in terms of quality, to the best current method from the literature. But BLS has the important advantage of being based on a vector space representation, which directly facilitates a number of useful operations, such as PCA analysis, k-means clustering, visualization etc. We also show that there is still potential for further improve of music similarity measures by combining BLS with another stateof-the-art algorithm; the combined algorithm then outperforms all other algorithms in our evaluation. Additionally, we discuss the problem of album and artist effects in the context of similaritybased recommendation and show that one can detect the presence of such effects in a given dataset by analyzing the nearest neighbor classification results.",,"Combined algorithms; Comprehensive evaluation; Contrast patterns; Correlation patterns; Data sets; Genre classification; K-means clustering; Music similarity; Nearest neighbor classification; PCA analysis; Similarity functions; Similarity measure; Spectral patterns; State-of-the-art algorithms; Vector space representation; Algorithms; Classification (of information); Quality control",,,,,,,,"Pohle, T., Schnitzer, D., Schedl, M., Knees, P., Widmer, G., On rhythm and general music similarity (2009) Proc. of the 10th Int.

Frequently these smartphones are also used as portable music players. In this paper we describe GeoShuffle - a prototype system for content-based music browsing and exploration that targets such devices. One of the most interesting aspects of these portable devices is the inclusion of positioning capabilities based on GPS. GeoShuffle adds location-based and time-based context to a user's listening preferences. Playlists are dynamically generated based on the location of the user, path and historical preferences. Browsing large music collections having thousands of tracks is challenging. The most common method of interaction is using long lists of textual metadata such as artist name or genre. Current smartphones are characterized by small screen real-estate which limits the amount of textual information that can be displayed. We propose selforganizing tag clouds, a 2D tag cloud representation that is based on an underlying self-organizing map calculated using automatically extracted audio features. To evalute the system the Magnatagatune database is utilized. The evaluation indicates that location and time context can improve the quality of music recommendation and that selforganizing tag clouds provide faster browsing and are more engaging than text-based tag clouds. © 2010 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.",,"Audio features; Computational capability; Content-based; Large music collections; Location based; Location-aware; Music recommendation; Portable device; Portable music player; Prototype system; Real-estates; Self organizing; Small screens; Tag clouds; Textual information; Textual metadata; Time contexts; Conformal mapping; Information retrieval; Metadata; Smartphones; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Widmer, G., Flexer, A., Schnitzer, D., Gasser, M., Playlist generation using start and end songs (2008) Int.

Modeling temporal dynamics in user behavior is not trivial, and it is challenging to study its effect in order to provide better recommendation results to users. To incorporate temporal effects into information filtering systems, we analyze a large sized real-world usage log data gathered from Bugs Music, which is one of the well-known online music service in Korea, and study temporal dynamics in users' music listening behaviors considering periodicity of time dimension and popularity change. We insist that the result of our analysis can be a useful guideline to the industry which delivers music items to users and tries to consider temporal context in their recommendations. © 2010 IEEE.","Context-awareness; Data analysis; Online music; Popularity; Recommendation; Temporal dynamics; Usage log analysis","Context- awareness; Data analysis; Log analysis; Online music; Popularity; Recommendation; Temporal dynamics; Data reduction; Dynamics; Information science; Online systems; Program debugging; Real time systems; Behavioral research",,,,,,,,"Wu, F., Huberman, B.A., Popularity, novelty and attention (2008) EC '08: Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, pp. 240-245. , ACM; Koren, Y., Collaborative filtering with temporal dynamics (2009) KDD '09: Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 447-456. , ACM; Koychev, I., Schwab, I., Adaptation to drifting user's interests (2000) Proceedings of ECML2000 Workshop: Machine Learning in New Information Age, pp. 39-46. , Citeseer; Ma, S., Li, X., Ding, Y., Orlowska, M., A recommender system with interest-drifting WISE'07: Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering, pp. 633-642. , Springer; Agarwal, D., Chen, B., Elango, P., Spatio-temporal models for estimating click-through rate (2009) WWW '09: Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 21-30. , ACM; Vlachos, M., Meek, C., Vagena, Z., Gunopulos, D., Identifying similarities, periodicities and bursts for online search queries (2004) SIGMOD '04: Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 131-142. , ACM; Shin, D., Won Lee, J., Yeon, J., Goo Lee, S., Context-aware recommendation by aggregating user context (2009) CEC' 09: IEEE Conference on Commerce and Enterprise Computing, pp. 423-430. , IEEE; Alonso, O., Gertz, M., Baeza-Yates, R., Clustering and exploring search results using timeline constructions (2009) CIKM '09: Proceeding of the 18th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 97-106. , ACM; Schafer, J., Frankowski, D., Herlocker, J., Sen, S., (2007) Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems, pp. 291-324; Ding, Y., Li, X., Time weight collaborative filtering (2005) CIKM '05: Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 485-492. , ACM; Ding, Y., Li, X., Orlowska, M., Recency-based collaborative filtering (2006) ADC '06: Proceedings of the 17th Australasian Database Conference, p. 107. , Australian Computer Society, Inc; Park, H., Yoo, J., Cho, S., A context-aware music recommendation system using fuzzy bayesian networks with utility theory (2006) Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 970-979; Pampalk, E., Pohle, T., Widmer, G., Dynamic playlist generation based on skipping behavior Proceedings of the 6th ISMIR Conference, 2005, pp. 634-637; Guo, L., Tan, E., Chen, S., Xiao, Z., Zhang, X., The stretched exponential distribution of internet media access patterns (2008) Proceedings of the Twenty-seventh ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing, pp. 283-294. , ACM; Das, A., Datar, M., Garg, A., Rajaram, S., Google news personalization: Scalable online collaborative filtering (2007) Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on World Wide Web, p. 280. , ACM; Adomavicius, G., Sankaranarayanan, R., Sen, S., Tuzhilin, A., Incorporating contextual information in recommender systems using a multidimensional approach (2005) ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 23 (1), pp. 103-145; Lee, D., Park, S.E., Kahng, M., Lee, S., Goo Lee, S., Exploiting contextual information from event logs for personalized recommendation (2010) 9th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science, Studies in Computational Intelligence, , Springer; Bass, F., Comments on a new product growth for model consumer durables: The Bass model (2004) Management Science, pp. 1833-1840; Lerman, K., Hogg, T., Using a model of social dynamics to predict popularity of news (2010) WWW '10: Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 621-630. , ACM","Park, C.

With properly equipped communication services, users can easily obtain the widely distributed videos, music, and documents they want. Because of its usability and capacity requirements, music is more popular than other types of multimedia data. Documents and videos are difficult to view on mobile phones' small screens, and videos' large data size results in high overhead for retrieval. But advanced compression techniques for music reduce the required storage space significantly and make the circulation of music data easier. This means that users can capture their favorite music directly from the Web without going to music stores. Accordingly, helping users find music they like in a large archive has become an attractive but challenging issue over the past few years. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Capacity requirement; Communication service; Compression techniques; Context information; Large data; Multimedia data; Music data; Music recommendation; Music stores; Real-time access; Small screens; Smart phones; Storage spaces; Mobile devices; Telephone sets; Information retrieval",,,,,"97EC17A02s1024

In this paper, we contributed in three distinctive ways to take into account the idea of context awareness in the music recommendation field. Firstly, we propose a novel emotion state transition model (ESTM) to model human emotional states and their transitions by music. ESTM acts like a bridge between user situation information along with his/her emotion and low-level music features. With ESTM, we can recommend the most appropriate music to the user for transiting to the desired emotional state. Secondly, we present context-based music recommendation (COMUS) ontology for modeling user's musical preferences and context, and for supporting reasoning about the user's desired emotion and preferences. The COMUS is music-dedicated ontology in OWL constructed by incorporating domain-specific classes for music recommendation into the Music Ontology, which includes situation, mood, and musical features. Thirdly, for mapping low-level features to ESTM, we collected various high-dimensional music feature data and applied nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for their dimension reduction. We also used support vector machine (SVM) as emotional state transition classifier. We constructed a prototype music recommendation system based on these features and carried out various experiments to measure its performance. We report some of the experimental results. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Classification; Emotion; Emotion state transition model; Mood; Music information retrieval; Recommendation","Context- awareness; Context-based; Dimension reduction; Domain specific; Emerging applications; Emotion classification; Emotional state; Feature data; High-dimensional; Human emotion; Low-level features; Music classification; Music information retrieval; Music ontology; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Musical features; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Ontology-based representation; Situation information; State transition models; Electronic musical instruments; Feature extraction; Information retrieval; Information services; Ontology; Support vector machines; User interfaces; Computer music",,,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF
