For instance, choosing which movie to watch is a simple, small-sized decision-making process. Recommender systems help people to make this kind of choices, usually by computing a short list of suggestions that reduces the space of possible options. These systems are strongly based on the knowledge of user preferences but, in order to fully support people, they should be grounded on a holistic view of the user behavior, that includes also how emotions, mood, and personality traits influence her choosing patterns. In this work, we investigate how to include emotional aspects in the recommendation process. We suggest that the affective state of the user, defined by a set of emotions (e.g., joy, surprise), constitutes part of choosing situation that should be taken into account when modeling user preferences. The main contribution of the paper is a general emotion-aware computational model based on affective user profiles in which each preference, such as a 5-star rating on a movie, is associated with the affective state felt by the user at the time when that preference was collected. The model estimates whether an unseen item is suitable for the current affective state of the user, by computing an affective coherence score that takes into account both the affective user profile and not-affective item features. The approach has been implemented into an Emotion-aware Music Recommender System, whose effectiveness has been assessed by performing in-vitro experiments on two benchmark datasets. The main outcome is that our system showed improved accuracy of recommendations compared to baselines which include no affective information in the recommendation model.;"[Polignano, Marco; de Gemmis, Marco; Semeraro, Giovanni] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Comp Sci, Via E Orabona 4, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Narducci, Fedelucio] Politecn Bari, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, Via E Orabona 4, I-70125 Bari, Italy";Narducci, F (corresponding author), Politecn Bari, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, Via E Orabona 4, I-70125 Bari, Italy.;"marco.polignano@uniba.it; fedelucio.narducci@poliba.it; marco.degemmis@uniba.it; Giovanni.semeraro@uniba.it";;narducci, fedelucio/0000-0002-9255-3256;Apulia Region, Italy, POR Puglia FESR-FSE 2014-2020 Innonetwork, project DECiSION: DATA-DRIVEN CUSTOMER SERVICE INNOVATION;The research has been partially funded by the Apulia Region, Italy, POR Puglia FESR-FSE 2014-2020 Innonetwork, project DECiSION: DATA-DRIVEN CUSTOMER SERVICE INNOVATION.;;82;0;0;18;18;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0957-4174;1873-6793;;EXPERT SYST APPL;Expert Syst.

This article focuses on a personalized music recommender system that incorporates rich content and context data in a unified and adaptive way to address the abovementioned problems. The content information includes music textual content, such as metadata, tags, and lyrics, and the context data incorporate users' behaviors, including music listening records, music playing sequences, and sessions. Specifically, a heterogeneous information network (HIN) is first presented to incorporate different kinds of content and context data. Then, a novel method called content- and context-aware music embedding (CAME) is proposed to obtain the low-dimension dense real-valued feature representations (embeddings) of music pieces from HIN. Especially, one music piece generally highlights different aspects when interacting with various neighbors, and it should have different representations separately. CAME seamlessly combines deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms, with the embedding model to capture the intrinsic features of music pieces as well as their dynamic relevance and interactions adaptively. Finally, we further infer users' general musical preferences as well as their contextual preferences for music and propose a content- and context-aware music recommendation method. Comprehensive experiments as well as quantitative and qualitative evaluations have been performed on real-world music data sets, and the results show that the proposed recommendation approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is able to handle sparse data effectively.;"[Wang, Dongjing; Zhang, Xin; Yu, Dongjin] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Xu, Guandong] Univ Technol Sydney, Adv Analyt Inst, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Deng, Shuiguang] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China";Wang, DJ (corresponding author), Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.;"dongjing.wang@hdu.edu.cn; zhangxin@hdu.edu.cn; yudj@hdu.edu.cn; guandong.xu@uts.edu.au; dengsg@zju.edu.cn";;"Wang, Dongjing/0000-0003-2152-0446; Deng, Shuiguang/0000-0001-5015-6095; Yu, Dongjin/0000-0001-8919-1613; Xu, Guandong/0000-0003-4493-6663";"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LQ20F020015]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial University of Zhejiang [GK199900299012-017]";This work was supported in part by the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant LQ20F020015 and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial University of Zhejiang under Grant GK199900299012-017.;;61;0;0;7;7;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2162-237X;2162-2388;;IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR;IEEE Trans.

This has opened up a research area, namely the identification of biases introduced by recommender systems in the music context. Recent research, which focused on users of the Last.fm platform found that state-of-the-art music recommendation systems frequently tend to favor already popular items. To this end, we propose a new method for predicting music recommendations, which relies on a cluster-based quotas system. By assuming the distribution of the popularity of artists to have a latent variable that is estimated with a Gaussian Mixture, we find the underlying popularity clusters and use them to make the predictions by quotas that relate to each cluster mixing proportion, in a way that the resulting popularity distribution in the recommendations is closer to the popularity distribution seen in the data. In our experiments with the Last.fm data, our final predictions increased the recommendation frequencies of less popular artists, while preserving the specific characteristics of each algorithm. The GAP(g)(r) and mean average error (MAE) metrics are improved, showing that our recommendations are more accurate and approximate to the expected popularity of the artists in each user profile.;[Wundervald, Bruna] Maynooth Univ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland;Wundervald, B (corresponding author), Maynooth Univ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.;bruna.wundervald@mu.ie;;Wundervald, Bruna/0000-0001-8163-220X;;;;23;0;0;5;5;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;2192-6611;2192-662X;;INT J MULTIMED INF R;Int.

We have two motivations to extend the existing systems: (1) to the best of our knowledge, the current systems first estimate the user's emotions and then suggest music based on it. Therefore, the emotion estimation error affects the recommendation accuracy. (2) Studies show that the pattern of users' interactions with input devices can reflect their emotions. However, these patterns have not been used yet in emotion-aware music recommender systems. In this study, a music recommender system is proposed to suggest music based on users' keystrokes and mouse clicks patterns. Unlike the previous ones, the proposed system maps these patterns directly to the user's favorite music, without labeling its current emotion. The results show that even though this system does not use any additional device, it is highly accurate compared to previous methods.;"[Jazi, Saba Yousefian; Kaedi, Marjan; Fatemi, Afsaneh] Univ Isfahan, Fac Comp Engn, Hezar Jerib St, Esfahan 8174673441, Iran";Kaedi, M (corresponding author), Univ Isfahan, Fac Comp Engn, Hezar Jerib St, Esfahan 8174673441, Iran.;"saba.yousefian@mehr.ui.ac.ir; kaedi@eng.uiac.ir; a_fatemi@eng.ui.ac.ir";;;;;;44;0;0;3;3;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1380-7501;1573-7721;;MULTIMED TOOLS APPL;Multimed.

The typical approach towards this goal is to identify playlist characteristics by inspecting the existing tracks (i.e., seeds) in target playlists. However, seeds are not always available, especially when users create new playlists. For such cold-start situations, user-generated titles can be a good starting point to understand the intended purpose of users. This paper investigates the effectiveness of titles as an auxiliary data source for playlists suffering from the cold-start problem. Employing three naive recommendation models, we conduct experiments on one million music playlists from the Spotify platform. Our analyses show that the prevalent attitude in naming playlists results in highly accurate recommendations for playlists concerning a specific theme, such as albums, artists, and soundtracks. As the title space moves away from a particular theme, recommendation accuracy drops. Furthermore, the correlation between the common preference of a title and its usability in recommendation is quite weak; a title without a common sense may be useless in recommender systems, even though many users favor that title. Consequently, our findings serve as a guideline to develop title-aware recommendation approaches that can provide coherent continuations to the cold-start playlists.";"[Yurekli, Ali; Kaleli, Cihan] Eskisehir Tech Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-26555 Eskisehir, Turkey; [Bilge, Alper] Akdeniz Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-07070 Antalya, Turkey";Kaleli, C (corresponding author), Eskisehir Tech Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-26555 Eskisehir, Turkey.;"aliyurekli@eskisehir.edu.tr; abilge@akdeniz.edu.tr; ckaleli@eskisehir.edu.tr";Bilge, Alper/G-3583-2013;Bilge, Alper/0000-0003-3467-9915;Eskisehir Technical University [20ADP172];This work was supported by the Grant 20ADP172 from Eskisehir Technical University.;;36;0;0;6;6;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1868-5137;1868-5145;;J AMB INTEL HUM COMP;J.

In the field of music information retrieval and recommendation, emotion is considered contextual information that is hard to capture, albeit highly influential. In this study, we analyze the connection between users' emotional states and their musical choices. Particularly, we perform a large-scale study based on two data sets containing 560,000 and 90,000 #nowplaying tweets, respectively. We extract affective contextual information from hashtags contained in these tweets by applying an unsupervised sentiment dictionary approach. Subsequently, we utilize a state-of-the-art network embedding method to learn latent feature representations of users, tracks and hashtags. Based on both the affective information and the latent features, a set of eight ranking methods is proposed. We find that relying on a ranking approach that incorporates the latent representations of users and tracks allows for capturing a user's general musical preferences well (regardless of used hashtags or affective information). However, for capturing context-specific preferences (a more complex and personal ranking task), we find that ranking strategies that rely on affective information and that leverage hashtags as context information outperform the other ranking strategies.;"[Zangerle, Eva] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Comp Sci, Res Grp Data Bases & Informat Syst, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Chen, Chih-Ming] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Social Networks & Human Ctr Comp, Taipei 11605, Taiwan; [Tsai, Ming-Feng] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Taipei 11605, Taiwan; [Yang, Yi-Hsuan] Acad Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan";Zangerle, E (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Dept Comp Sci, Res Grp Data Bases & Informat Syst, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.;"eva.zangerle@uibk.ac.at; changecandy@gmail.com; mftsai@nccu.edu.tw; yang@citi.sinica.edu.tw";;Zangerle, Eva/0000-0003-3195-8273;Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 106-3114-E-002-007];The computational results presented have been achieved (in part) using the HPC infrastructure LEO of the University of Innsbruck.

It has achieved rapid development in theoretical research and practice. It selects information and similarity relationships based on the user's history and collects others that are the same as the user's hobbies. User's evaluation information is to generate recommendations. The main research is the inadequate combination of context information and the mining of new points of interest in the context-aware recommendation process. On the basis of traditional recommendation technology, in view of the characteristics of the context information in music recommendation, a personalized and personalized music based on popularity prediction is proposed. Recommended algorithm is MRAPP (Media Recommendation Algorithm based on Popularity Prediction). The algorithm first analyzes the user's contextual information under music recommendation and classifies and models the contextual information. The traditional content-based recommendation technology CB calculates the recommendation results and then, for the problem that content-based recommendation technology cannot recommend new points of interest for users, introduces the concept of popularity. First, we use the memory and forget function to reduce the score and then consider user attributes and product attributes to calculate similarity; secondly, we use logistic regression to train feature weights; finally, appropriate weights are used to combine user-based and item-based collaborative filtering recommendation results. Based on the above improvements, the improved collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm in this paper has greatly improved the prediction accuracy.

Music therapists have the potential to address some needs of older adults, but the effectiveness of music interventions is dependent on the perception of spoken and musical stimuli. Nonauditory information, such as contextual (e.g., keywords, picture related to song) and visual cues (e.g., clear view of singer's face), can improve speech perception. The purpose of this study was to examine the benefit of contextual and visual cues on sung word recognition in the presence of guitar accompaniment. The researcher tested 24 community-dwelling older adult hearing aid (HA) users recruited through a university HA clinic and laboratory under 3 study conditions: (a) auditory stimuli only, (b) auditory stimuli with contextual cues, and (c) auditory stimuli with visual cues. Both visual and contextual nonauditory cues benefited participants on sung word recognition. Participants' music background and training were predictive of success without nonauditory cues, and visual cues provided greater benefit than contextual cues. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that music therapists increase the accessibility of music interventions reliant upon lyric recognition through the incorporation of clear visual and contextual cues.;[Wilhelm, Lindsey A.] Colorado State Univ, Sch Mus Theatre & Dance, 1778 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA;Wilhelm, LA (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Sch Mus Theatre & Dance, 1778 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.;Lindsey.Wilhelm@colostate.edu;;;Graduate College at The University of Iowa;This research was supported in part through financial support from Dr. Richard and Mrs. Ellen Caplan in addition to a Graduate Student Research Grant from the Graduate College at The University of Iowa awarded in 2015.;;49;0;0;4;4;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;0022-2917;2053-7395;;J MUSIC THER;J.

However, while discarding users' contexts, profiles information is not able to reflect their exact needs and to provide overpowering recommendations. One of the main issues that have to be considered before the conception of context-aware recommender systems (CARS) is the estimation of the relevance of contextual information. The use of irrelevant or superfluous contextual factors can generate serious problems about the complexity and the quality of recommendations. In this paper, we introduce a multi-dimensional context model for music CARS. We started by the acquisition of explicit items rating from a population in various possible contextual situations. Thus, we proposed a user-based methodology aiming to judge the relation between contextual factors and musical genres. Next, we applied the Multiple Linear Regression technique on users' perceived ratings, to define an order of importance between contextual dimensions.

While such platforms provide access to millions of songs, the sheer volume of choices available renders it hard for users to find songs they like. Consequently, the task of finding music the user likes is often mitigated by music recommender systems, which aim to provide recommendations that match the user's current context. Particularly in the field of music recommendation, adapting recommendations to the user's current context is critical as, throughout the day, users listen to different music in numerous different contexts and situations. Therefore, we propose a multi-context-aware user model and track recommender system thatjointlyexploit information about the current situation and musical preferences of users. Our proposed system clusters users based on their situational context features and similarly, clusters music tracks based on their content features.

Social networks enclose valuable data regarding user behavior and connections that can be exploited in this area to infer knowledge about user preferences and social influence. The fact that streaming music platforms have some social functionalities also allows this type of information to be used for music recommendation. In this work, we take advantage of the friendship structure to address a type of recommendation bias derived from the way collaborative filtering methods compute the neighborhood. These methods restrict the rating predictions for a user to the items that have been rated by their nearest neighbors while leaving out other items that might be of his/her interest. This problem is different from the popularity bias caused by the power-law distribution of the item rating frequency (long-tail), well-known in the music domain, although both shortcomings can be related. Our proposal is based on extending and diversifying the neighborhood by capturing trust and homophily effects between users through social structure metrics. The results show an increase in potentially recommendable items while reducing recommendation error rates.;"[Sanchez-Moreno, Diego; Loepez Batista, Vivian; Vicente, M.

The majority of these services are endowed with recommendation mechanisms that help users to discover songs and artists that may interest them from the vast amount of music available. However, many are not reliable as they may not take into account contextual aspects or the ever-evolving user behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to develop systems that consider these aspects. In the field of music, time is one of the most important factors influencing user preferences and managing its effects, and is the motivation behind the work presented in this paper. Here, the temporal information regarding when songs are played is examined. The purpose is to model both the evolution of user preferences in the form of evolving implicit ratings and user listening behavior. In the collaborative filtering method proposed in this work, daily listening habits are captured in order to characterize users and provide them with more reliable recommendations. The results of the validation prove that this approach outperforms other methods in generating both context-aware and context-free recommendations.;"[Sanchez-Moreno, Diego; Moreno-Garcia, Maria N.] Univ Salamanca, Dept Comp Sci & Automat, Salamanca 37008, Spain; [Zheng, Yong] IIT, Dept Informat Technol & Management, Chicago, IL 60616 USA";Moreno-Garcia, MN (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Dept Comp Sci & Automat, Salamanca 37008, Spain.;"sanchezhh@gmail.com; yzheng66@iit.edu; mmg@usal.es";"Garcia, Maria N Moreno/P-4608-2014; Zheng, Yong/AAF-8921-2020";"Garcia, Maria N Moreno/0000-0003-2809-3707; Zheng, Yong/0000-0003-4990-4580";Junta de Castilla y Leon, SpainJunta de Castilla y Leon [SA064G19];This research was funded by the Junta de Castilla y Leon, Spain, grant number: SA064G19.;;81;1;1;5;6;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2076-3417;;APPL SCI-BASEL;Appl.

A large number of existing digital music libraries have improved awareness among people through the music recommendation approach. However, several critical technical challenges still require attention and must be well-addressed to provide a reliable recommendation to music listeners. In Indian Classical Music, Raga is composed of coalescing diverse musical note structures. The history of classical music unveils that every raga possesses some distinct sessions. With a vast collection of classical music files in online music libraries, locating and listening to classical music is no more a difficult task. However, searching and listening to the audio of one's preference may not be simple as it must instinctively satisfy the listener's preference in a precise session. In this paper, a system termed as iMusic has been proposed to classify, analyze, and recommend the session-sensitive performance of Indian classical music by analyzing the musical note structures followed by features matching. Available note-patterns in the raga performance have been illustrated using a deep neural network and a set of machine learning algorithms where raga samples have been represented as inputs in the projected network and are classified based on the performing sessions. A context-aware k-means clustering algorithm has also been illustrated, entitled as a data filtering algorithm. The proficiency of the filtering algorithm has been established in two ways. Primarily, as a data-sensitive analysis, and second as empirical studies on synthetically obtained real classical music dataset () to put on the hybrid music recommendation. In this work, a case-study of session-sensitive Indian music recommender system has been demonstrated using key-strategies viz. listener modelling, representation learning, and music profiling. Eventually, several evaluation metrics have been discussed to characterize the effectiveness of proposed representation learning-based playing session-sensitive music recommendation strategies. The proposed iMusic system renders data classification accuracy of similar to 88%. Such a framework could provide a useful basis regarding studies on hybrid music recommendation systems based on the usefulness of end-users.;"[Roy, Samarjit; Biswas, Mousumi; De, Debashis] Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ctr Mobile Cloud Comp, BF 142,Sect 1, Kolkata 700064, W Bengal, India; [De, Debashis] Univ Western Australia, Dept Phys, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia";"De, D (corresponding author), Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ctr Mobile Cloud Comp, BF 142,Sect 1, Kolkata 700064, W Bengal, India.; De, D (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Dept Phys, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.";dr.debashis.de@gmail.com;ROY, SAMARJIT/AAT-6734-2020;"ROY, SAMARJIT/0000-0002-7874-8348; De, Debashis/0000-0002-9688-9806";University Grant Commission (UGC), Govt. of IndiaUniversity Grants Commission, India;Authors are grateful to the University Grant Commission (UGC), Govt. of India, for sanctioning a research fellowship under which this contribution has been completed.

However, we know little about how to recommend songs that are motivational for people given their contexts and activities. As a first step towards dealing with this issue, we adopt a theory-driven approach and operationalize the Brunel Music Rating Inventory (BMRI) to identify motivational qualities of music from the audio signal. When we look at frequently listened songs for 14 common daily activities through the lens of motivational music qualities, we find that they are clustered into three high-level latent activity groups: calm, vibrant, and intense. We show that our BMRI features can accurately classify songs in the three classes, thus enabling tools to select and recommend activity-specific songs from existing music libraries without any input required from user. We present the results of a preliminary user evaluation of our song recommender (called PepMusic) and discuss the implications for recommending songs for daily activities.;"[Kim, Yongsung] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Aiello, Luca Maria; Quercia, Daniele] Nokia Bell Labs, Cambridge, England; [Quercia, Daniele] Kings Coll London, CUSP, London, England";Kim, Y (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;yk@u.northwestern.edu;;;;;;39;0;0;0;1;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;;2193-1127;;EPJ DATA SCI;EPJ Data Sci.;MAY 24;2020;9;1;;;;;;;13;10.1140/epjds/s13688-020-0221-9;;;19;"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods";"Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences";LQ6TN;WOS:000535134300001;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-05-14;

This paper provides a reflective review of the research literature in the field that is categorized in three contexts: education, mental health, and community. Grouping knowledge in this way affords a new perspective on how music therapists describe adolescents, including the terms we use to describe them, the types of programs we offer, the approaches to research that are most popular, and the way we talk about the focus of therapy. Distinctions between research in these fields are highlighted, with reference to the beliefs and values that are most congruent with each of these contexts. Following this reflective review on the literature, I provide five recommendations for consideration by researchers and practitioners. These include: determining if and when evidence is an appropriate focus; continuing to seek understanding; not underestimating the value of positive experiences; avoiding an exclusive focus on the music therapist's perspective; and being realistic about the outcomes of group versus individual therapy.

However, in addition to gathering information about users' tastes, there is an additional aspect that can be relevant for a proper codification strategy, namely the order in which the user interacted with the items. In this paper, several encoding strategies based on neural networks are analyzed and applied to solve two different recommendation tasks in the context of music playlists. The results show that the order in which the musical pieces were listened to is relevant for the codification of items (songs).

Conventional music recommendation systems are, however, in general based on the simple user-track relationships or the content of songs and recommend songs according to intrinsic factors. Furthermore they do not consider the users' contextual factors towards providing them with a more interpretable, efficient and smart recommendation experience. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Information Network-based Music Recommendation System (HIN-MRS). By considering the extrinsic factors, such as contextual factors, internal factors, such as the user's personalized preference, and the heterogeneous relationship between items of song information, this method can perceive the user's music selection from multiple aspects, automatically maintain the user's playlist and improve the user's music experience. First we used the obtained textual data to extract the user's music preference to provide the topic which is usually related to the contextual factors, by means of which an HIN-MRS can realize the perception of the mobile environment. Second, after determining the topics, we built a small-scale HIN of songs (song HIN) according to topics and used a graph-based algorithm to generate recommendations. The recommendation method based on an HIN renders the recommendation process more efficient and the recommendation results more accurate and increases the users satisfaction. The results of our final experiments also prove the significant advantages of the proposed model over the conventional approaches.;"[Wang, Ranran; Ma, Xiao; Jiang, Chi; Ye, Yi] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Informat & Safety Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yin] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China";Zhang, Y (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China.;"ran.ran.wang@stu.zuel.edu.cn; cindyma@zuel.edu.cn; jiangc35@zuel.edu.cn; yixia@stu.zuel.edu.cn; yin.zhang.cn@ieee.org";Zhang, Yin/O-2149-2015;Zhang, Yin/0000-0002-1772-0763;"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702553]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, China [2722019JCT037, 201911424]";This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant number 61702553, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, China (Grant numbers: 2722019JCT037 and 201911424).;;38;3;4;4;13;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0140-3664;1873-703X;;COMPUT COMMUN;Comput.

In this paper, we develop a smartphone-based mobile system that includes two core modules for recognizing human activities and then accordingly recommending music. In the proposed method, a deep residual bidirectional gated recurrent neural network is applied to obtain high activity recognition accuracy from accelerometer signals on the smartphone. In order to improve the performance of tempo-oriented music classification, an ensemble of dynamic classification using a long-term modulation spectrum and sequence classification using a short-term spectrogram is used. Music recommendation is performed using the relationship between the recognized human activities and the music files indexed by tempooriented music classification that reflects user preference models in order to achieve high user satisfaction.

Instead of capturing general user preferences, the task of next-item recommendation focuses on revealing specific session preferences encoded in the most recent user interactions. This study focuses on the music domain, particularly on the task of music playlist continuation, a paradigmatic case of next-item recommendation. While the accuracy achieved in next-song recommendations is important, in this work we shift our focus toward a deeper understanding of fundamental playlist characteristics, namely the song order, the song context and the song popularity, and their relation to the recommendation of playlist continuations. We also propose an approach to assess the quality of the recommendations that mitigates known problems of off-line experiments for music recommender systems. Our results indicate that knowing a longer song context has a positive impact on next-song recommendations. We find that the long-tailed nature of the playlist datasets makes simple and highly expressive playlist models appear to perform comparably, but further analysis reveals the advantage of using highly expressive models. Finally, our experiments suggest that the song order is not crucial to accurately predict next-song recommendations.;"[Vall, Andreu; Schedl, Markus; Widmer, Gerhard] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Computat Percept, Linz, Austria; [Widmer, Gerhard] Austrian Res Inst Artificial Intelligence, Vienna, Austria; [Quadrana, Massimo] Pandora Media Inc, Oakland, CA USA";Vall, A (corresponding author), Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Computat Percept, Linz, Austria.;"andreu.vall@jku.at; mquadrana@pandora.com; markus.schedl@jku.at; gerhard.widmer@jku.at";Widmer, Gerhard/B-8218-2017;Widmer, Gerhard/0000-0003-3531-1282;;;;33;2;2;0;0;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;2192-6611;2192-662X;;INT J MULTIMED INF R;Int.

Golfers, coaches, and sport psychology practitioners alike may benefit from understanding and utilizing music within their work. Since music use in golf has become an increasingly common practice, the purpose of the current study was to investigate current music use among golfers using a qualitative approach. Researchers aimed to identify potential psychological and physiological effects derived from music use during golf practice and pre-performance, given the limited empirical research in this area to date. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten amateur and semi-professional golfers (five male, five female, M-age = 22.9 years, SD = 5.04 years). Consensual qualitative research (CQR) methodology was used to analyze the interview data. Six domains emerged from the CQR analysis regarding participants' self-reported music use in golf: tempo, attention, physiological regulation, psychological regulation, effects of music on performance perceptions, and context (to use or not to use). Given the capacity of carefully selected music to elicit profound affective, neurophysiological, and behavioral responses, there is clear potential for mental performance consultants to utilize music in working with golfers in training contexts.

We have been witnessing an ever-increasing amount of music data. At the same time, with the huge amount of online music data, users are facing an everyday struggle to obtain their interested music pieces. To solve this problem, music search and recommendation systems are helpful for users to find their favorite content from a huge repository of music. However, social influence, which contains rich information about similar interests between users and users' frequent correlation actions, has been largely ignored in previous music recommender systems. In this work, we explore the effects of social influence on developing effective music recommender systems and focus on the problem of social influence aware music recommendation, which aims at recommending a list of music tracks for a target user. To exploit social influence in social influence aware music recommendation, we first construct a heterogeneous social network, propose a novel meta path-based similarity measure called WPC, and denote the framework of similarity measure in this network. As a step further, we use the topological potential approach to mine social influence in heterogeneous networks. Finally, in order to improve music recommendation by incorporating social influence, we present a factor graphic model based on social influence. Our experimental results on one real world dataset verify that our proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art music recommendation methods substantially.;"[Chen, Jinpeng] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Software Engn, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China; [Ying, Pinguang] Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch WTO Res & Educ, Shanghai 200336, Peoples R China; [Zou, Ming] Beihang Univ, State Key Lab Software Dev Environm, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China";Chen, JP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Software Engn, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.;jpchen@bupt.edu.cn;;;"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702043]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [500417062]";This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61702043, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant No. 500417062.;;47;6;9;9;48;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1380-7501;1573-7721;;MULTIMED TOOLS APPL;Multimed.

However, recent work has unveiled the importance of other aspects of the recommendation process, including explanation, transparency, control and user experience in general. Building on these aspects, this paper introduces MoodPlay, an interactive music-artists recommender system which integrates content and mood-based filtering in a novel interface. We show how MoodPlay allows the user to explore a music collection by musical mood dimensions, building upon GEMS, a music-specific model of affect, rather than the traditional Circumplex model. We describe system architecture, algorithms, interface and interactions followed by use-case and offline evaluations of the system, providing evidence of the benefits of our model based on similarities between the typical moods found in an artist's music, for contextual music recommendation. Finally, we present results of a user study (N = 279) in which four versions of the interface are evaluated with varying degrees of visualization and interaction. Results show that our proposed visualization of items and mood information improves user acceptance and understanding of both the underlying data and the recommendations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the role of mood in music recommendation, considering both artists' mood and users' self-reported mood in the user study. Our results and discussion highlight the impact of visual and interactive features in music recommendation, as well as associated human-cognitive limitations. This research also aims to inform the design of future interactive recommendation systems.;"[Andjelkovic, Ivana; O'Donovan, John] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Parra, Denis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Vicuna Mackenna Santiago 4860, Santiago, Chile";Andjelkovic, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;"iva.andel@gmail.com; dparras@uc.cl; jod@cs.ucsb.edu";"Parra, Denis/D-1388-2014; Parra, Denis/M-2967-2019";"Parra, Denis/0000-0001-9878-8761; ";"U.S. Army Research LaboratoryUnited States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL) [W911NF-09-2-0053]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150783]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)";"This work was partially supported by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement No. W911NF-09-2-0053; The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of ARL, NSF, or the U.S.Government.

Due to geographical, socio-economic, linguistic, and cultural factors as well as friendship networks, users in different countries may have different music preferences. Investigating cultural-socio-economic factors that might be associated with between-country differences in music preferences can facilitate music information retrieval, contribute to the prediction of users' music preferences, and improve music recommendation in cross-country contexts. However, previous literature provides limited empirical evidence of the relationships between possible cross-country differences on a wide range of socio-economic aspects and those in music preferences. To bridge this research gap, and drawing on a large-scale dataset, LFM-1b, this study examines the possible relationship between cross-country differences in artist, album, and genre listening frequencies as well as the cross-country distance in geographical, socio-economic, linguistic, cultural, and friendship connections using the Quadratic Assignment Procedure. Results indicate: (1) there is no significant relationship between geographical and economic distance on album, artist, and genre preferences' distance at the country-level; (2) the cross-country distance of three cultural dimensions (masculinity, long-term orientation, and indulgence) is positively associated with both the album and artist preferences distances; (3) the between-country distance in main languages has a positive relationship with the album, artist, and genre preferences distances across countries; (4) the density of friendship connections among countries negatively correlates to the cross-country preference distances in terms of artist and genre.

The proposed framework leverages the available semantic labels (in terms of tags) of music tracks to complement a highly sparse user-item interaction matrix, which effectively addresses the data sparsity issue faced by most music recommendation systems. Music tracks are more accurately represented by aggregating the latent factors derived from both the tag space and the user interaction information. The proposed framework further employs a Gaussian state-space model to capture the evolving nature of users' preferences over time, which helps achieve time-sensitive recommendation of music. A variational approximation is developed to achieve fast inference and learning of model parameters. Experiments conducted using actual music data and comparison with state-of-the-art competitive recommendation algorithms help demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

However, it still needs to be studied how to obtain and utilize the contextual information. In this paper, we propose a context-aware music recommendation approach, which can recommend music pieces appropriate for users' contextual preferences for music. In analogy to matrix factorization methods for collaborative filtering, the proposed approach does not require music pieces to be represented by features ahead, but it can learn the representations from users' historical listening records. Specifically, the proposed approach first learns music pieces' embeddings (feature vectors in low-dimension continuous space) from music listening records and corresponding metadata. Then it infers and models users' global and contextual preferences for music from their listening records with the learned embeddings. Finally, it recommends appropriate music pieces according to the target user's preferences to satisfy her/his real-time requirements. Experimental evaluations on a real-world dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, and hitrate.

Finding the correlation between the user data (e.g., location, time of the day, music listening history, emotion, etc.) and the music is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware personalized music recommendation system (EPMRS) to extract the correlation between the user data and the music. To achieve this correlation, we combine the outputs of two approaches: the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) approach and the weighted feature extraction (WFE) approach. The DCNN approach is used to extract the latent features from music data (e.g., audio signals and corresponding metadata) for classification. In the WFE approach, we generate the implicit user rating for music to extract the correlation between the user data and the music data. In the WFE approach, we use the term-frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach to generate the implicit user ratings for the music. Later, the EPMRS recommends songs to the user based on calculated implicit user rating for the music. We use the million songs dataset (MSD) to train the EPMRS. For performance comparison, we take the content similarity music recommendation system (CSMRS) as well as the personalized music recommendation system based on electroencephalography feedback (PMRSE) as the baseline systems. Experimental results show that the EPMRS produces better accuracy of music recommendations than the CSMRS and the PMRSE. Moreover, we build the Android and iOS APPs to get realistic data of user experience on the EPMRS. The collected feedback from anonymous users also show that the EPMRS sufficiently reflect their preference on music.;"[Abdul, Ashu] Chang Gung Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan; [Chen, Jenhui; Liao, Hua-Yuan; Chang, Shun-Hao] Chang Gung Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan; [Chen, Jenhui] Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Taoyuan 33375, Taiwan; [Chen, Jenhui] Ming Chi Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei 24301, Taiwan";"Chen, JH (corresponding author), Chang Gung Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan.; Chen, JH (corresponding author), Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Taoyuan 33375, Taiwan.; Chen, JH (corresponding author), Ming Chi Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei 24301, Taiwan.";"ashu.a507@gmail.com; jhchen@mail.cgu.edu.tw; nmxzqw@gmail.com; abide0222@gmail.com";;Ashu, A/0000-0003-0221-8225;Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 106-2221-E-182-065];This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under Contract MOST 106-2221-E-182-065.;;28;6;6;1;15;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2076-3417;;APPL SCI-BASEL;Appl.

Although existing methods of similar retrieval or sequence prediction have attained success to some extend, one important factor has not been considered in the previous work, that is, users may change their music interest in different sessions. How to define the users' current interest is still a problem. In this paper, we propose a topic-based probabilistic model for addressing this problem by developing session-aware latent topics to model the users' listening behavior. The model is designed based on the insight that users' listening behavior is subjected to not only their personal interest, but also to their special interest in the session. Specifically, when making recommendation, our model estimates the probability of the song selection based on the mixture of the two aspects with a weight-based scheme. We have conducted experiments on a real music dataset from Last.fm.

However, users' preferences may vary in different contexts or in response to changing emotions. In recent years, some studies have affirmed the important roles of context and emotions in music recommendation, and include context or emotions to their system design; however, few studies take both context and emotions simultaneously into consideration. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to enhance the prediction of a user's preference; this approach incorporates the factors of context and emotion and aims to provide users with a more simple, intuitive and enjoyable listening experience. In addition, we adopt serviced-oriented architecture to implement our music recommendation system to which new innovative services can be easily added or integrated to provide more flexible services in the future. We also present the evaluation results of the prediction accuracy and users satisfaction.";"[Wang, Chen-Ya] Natl Open Univ, Dept Management & Informat, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wang, Yu-Chi; Chou, Seng-Cho T.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Informat Management, Taipei, Taiwan";Wang, CY (corresponding author), Natl Open Univ, Dept Management & Informat, Taipei, Taiwan.;"ntuimgrace@gmail.com; r95024@im.ntu.edu.tw; chou@ntu.edu.tw";;;;;;56;2;2;3;12;LIBRARY & INFORMATION CENTER, NAT DONG HWA UNIV;HUALIEN;LIBRARY & INFORMATION CENTER, NAT DONG HWA UNIV, HUALIEN, 00000, TAIWAN;1607-9264;2079-4029;;J INTERNET TECHNOL;J.

The most existing models only focus on explicit data like ratings and other user-item dimensions. A challenging problem in music recommendation is to model a variety of contextual information, such as feedback, time and location. In this article, we proposed a competent hybrid music recommender system (HMRS), which works on context and collaborative approaches. The timestamp is extracted from users listening log to construct a decision context behavior that extracted various temporal features like a week, sessions(as morning, evening or night). We used depth-first-search (DFS) algorithm which traverses the whole graph through the paths in different contexts. Bellman-Ford algorithm provides ranked list of recommended items with multi-layer context graph. We enhanced the process using particle swarm optimization (PSO) which produced highly optimized results. The dataset is used from Last.fm which contains 19,150,868 music listening logs of 992 users (till May, 4th 2009). We extract the properties of music from user's listening history and evaluate the efficient system to recommend music based on user's contextual preferences. Our system noticeably delivers the best recommendations regarding recall results when compared to existing methods.;"[Katarya, Rahul; Verma, Om Prakash] Delhi Technol Univ, Delhi Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Main Bawana Rd, Delhi 110042, India";Katarya, R (corresponding author), Delhi Technol Univ, Delhi Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Main Bawana Rd, Delhi 110042, India.;rahulkatarya@dtu.ac.in;Katarya, Rahul/AAH-9233-2020;Katarya, Rahul/0000-0001-7763-291X;;;;52;19;19;0;16;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1380-7501;1573-7721;;MULTIMED TOOLS APPL;Multimed.

In order to do so, a group of students participated in a study-abroad program in music therapy, involving classroom learning, community building, a clinical placement, and attendance at an international conference. A sample of these students participated in a qualitative interview study to explore what they learned. Results suggest that the program led to changes in students' views of music therapy practice, the music therapy profession, and their definition of music therapy. The profession of music therapy is thus viewed as culturally situated, underscoring the importance of cultural self-awareness. The discussion contextualizes the results of these learning experiences using a Piagetian framework. Recommendations for music therapy faculty and organizations are drawn from the study findings.;[Keith, Douglas R.] Georgia Coll, Milledgeville, GA 31059 USA;Keith, DR (corresponding author), Georgia Coll, Dept Creat Arts Therapies, CBX 067, Milledgeville, GA 31059 USA.;douglas.keith@gcsu.edu;;;;;;27;1;1;0;2;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;0734-6875;2053-7387;;MUSIC THER PERSPECT;Music Ther.

However, users cannot browse manually millions of tracks to find music they like. Building recommender systems suggesting music fitting the current context of a user is a challenging task. A deeper understanding for the characteristics ofuser-curated playlists naturally contributes to more personalized recommendations. To get a deeper understanding of how users organize music nowadays, we analyze user-curated playlists from the music streaming platform Spotify. Based on the audio features of the tracks, we find an explanation of differences in the playlists using a PCA and are able to group playlists using spectral clustering. Our findings about playlist characteristics can be exploited in a SVD-based music recommender system and our proposed clustering approach for finding groups of similar playlists is easy to integrate into a recommender system using pre-or post-filtering techniques.;"[Pichl, Martin] Univ Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria; [Zangerle, Eva] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Comp Sci, Res Grp Databases & Informat Syst, Innsbruck, Austria; [Specht, Guenther] Univ Innsbruck, DBIS Grp, Innsbruck, Austria";Pichl, M (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.;;;;;;;28;1;1;3;34;IGI GLOBAL;HERSHEY;701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA;1947-8534;1947-8542;;INT J MULTIMED DATA;Int.

We reviewed 19 experimental contextual music systems and found that while the context factors of location, time, activity, and identity are adopted in a wide variety of ways, the systems mainly rely on common UI solutions for interacting with these factors. Specifically, context factors could be employed to offer explanations, transparency, and visualizations of music recommendations in more explorative ways, providing novel user experiences.

Consequently, there has been an increasing demand in studying intelligent techniques to facilitate context-aware music recommendation. However, one important context that is generally overlooked is user's venue, which often includes surrounding atmosphere, correlates with activities, and greatly influences the user's music preferences. In this article, we present a novel venue-aware music recommender system called VenueMusic to effectively identify suitable songs for various types of popular venues in our daily lives. Toward this goal, a Location-aware Topic Model (LTM) is proposed to (i) mine the common features of songs that are suitable for a venue type in a latent semantic space and (ii) represent songs and venue types in the shared latent space, in which songs and venue types can be directly matched. It is worth mentioning that to discover meaningful latent topics with the LTM, a Music Concept Sequence Generation (MCSG) scheme is designed to extract effective semantic representations for songs. An extensive experimental study based on two large music test collections demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed topic model and MCSG scheme. The comparisons with state-of-the-art music recommender systems demonstrate the superior performance of VenueMusic system on recommendation accuracy by associating venue and music contents using a latent semantic space. This work is a pioneering study on the development of a venue-aware music recommender system. The results show the importance of considering the influence of venue types in the development of context-aware music recommender systems.;"[Cheng, Zhiyong; Shen, Jialie] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, 80 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178902, Singapore";Shen, JL (corresponding author), Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, 80 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178902, Singapore.;"zy.cheng.2011@phdis.smu.edu.sg; jlshen@smu.edu.sg";"Shen, Jialie/AAX-6851-2020; SHEN, Jialie/E-8573-2012";;Singapore Ministry of Education under Academic Research Fund Tier-2 (MOE) [MOE2013-T2-2-156];This work is supported by Singapore Ministry of Education under Academic Research Fund Tier-2 (MOE Ref: MOE2013-T2-2-156).;;63;71;72;1;20;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1046-8188;1558-2868;;ACM T INFORM SYST;ACM Trans.

This chapter presents a technical approach that exploits the congruence of emotions raised by music and places to identify music tracks that match a place of interest (POI). Such technique can be used in location-aware music recommendation services. For instance, a mobile city guide may play music related to the place visited by a tourist, or an in-car navigation system may adapt music to places the car is passing by. We address the problem of matching music to places by employing a controlled vocabulary of emotion labels. We hypothesize that the commonality of these emotions could provide, among other approaches, the base for establishing a degree of match between a place and a music track, i. e., finding music that feels right for the place. Through a series of user studies we show the correctness of our hypothesis. We compare the proposed emotion-based matching approach with a personalized approach where the music track is matched to the music preferences of the user, and to a knowledge-based approach which matches music to places based on metadata (e. g., matching music that was composed during the same period that the place of interestwas built in). We showthat when evaluating the goodness of fit between places and music, personalization is not sufficient and that the users perceive the emotionbased music suggestions as better fitting the places. The results also suggest that emotion-based and knowledge-based techniques can be combined to complement each other.;"[Kaminskas, Marius] Univ Coll Cork, Insight Ctr Data Analyt, Cork, Ireland; [Ricci, Francesco] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Comp Sci, Bozen Bolzano, Italy";Kaminskas, M (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Insight Ctr Data Analyt, Cork, Ireland.;"marius.kaminskas@insight-centre.org; francesco.ricci@unibz.it";;;;;;41;3;3;0;0;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;1571-5035;2524-4477;"978-3-319-31413-6; 978-3-319-31411-2";HUM-COMPUT INT-SPRIN;;;2016;;;;;;;287;310;;10.1007/978-3-319-31413-6_14;10.1007/978-3-319-31413-6;;24;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Psychology, Applied; Psychology, Experimental; Psychology, Social";"Computer Science; Psychology";BG4YI;WOS:000389269400015;;;;;2021-05-14;

User emotion, as one of the most important contexts, has the potential to improve music recommendation, but has not yet been fully explored due to the great difficulty of emotion acquisition. This article utilizes users' microblogs to extract their emotions at different granularity levels and during different time windows. The approach then correlates three elements: user, music and the user's emotion when he/she is listening to the music piece. Based on the associations extracted from a data set crawled from a Chinese Twitter service, we develop several emotion-aware methods to perform music recommendation. We conduct a series of experiments and show that the proposed solution proves that considering user emotional context can indeed improve recommendation performance in terms of hit rate, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The idea is to recommend information that a user would be interested in according to the user's surrounding context. Although remarkable progress has been made to contextualize music playback, relatively little research has been made using a large collection of real-life listening records collected in situ. In light of this fact, we present in this article a quantitative study of the personal, situational, and musical factors of musical preference in a smartphone context, using a new dataset comprising the listening records and self-report context annotation of 48 participants collected over 3wk via an Android app. Although the number of participants is limited and the population is biased towards students, the dataset is unique in that it is collected in a daily context, with sensor data and music listening profiles recorded at the same time. We investigate 3 core research questions evaluating the strength of a rich set of low-level and high-level audio features for music usage auto-tagging (i.e., music preference in different user activities), the strength of time-domain and frequency-domain sensor features for user activity classification, and how user factors such as personality traits are correlated with the predictability of music usage and user activity, using a closed set of 8 activity classes. We provide an in-depth discussion of the main findings of this study and their implications for the development of context-based music services for smartphones.;"[Yang, Yi-Hsuan; Teng, Yuan-Ching] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Informat Technol Innovat, Taipei 11564, Taiwan";Yang, YH (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Informat Technol Innovat, Taipei 11564, Taiwan.;"yang@citi.sinica.edu.tw; spencer@citi.sinica.edu.tw";Campailla, Jasmin/AAK-2420-2021;;National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 102-2221-E-001-004-MY3];This work was supported by the National Science Council of Taiwan under Grant NSC 102-2221-E-001-004-MY3.;;74;5;5;0;20;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;2160-6455;2160-6463;;ACM T INTERACT INTEL;ACM Trans.

Previous research has demonstrated that not only does listening to suitable music while driving not impair driving performance, but it could lead to an improved mood and a more relaxed body state, which could improve driving performance and promote safe driving significantly. In this article, we propose SAfeDJ, a smartphone-based situation-aware music recommendation system, which is designed to turn driving into a safe and enjoyable experience. SAfeDJ aims at helping drivers to diminish fatigue and negative emotion. Its design is based on novel interactive methods, which enable in-car smartphones to orchestrate multiple sources of sensing data and the drivers' social context, in collaboration with cloud computing to form a seamless crowdsensing solution. This solution enables different smartphones to collaboratively recommend preferable music to drivers according to each driver's specific situations in an automated and intelligent manner. Practical experiments of SAfeDJ have proved its effectiveness in music-mood analysis, and mood-fatigue detections of drivers with reasonable computation and communication overheads on smartphones. Also, our user studies have demonstrated that SAfeDJ helps to decrease fatigue degree and negative mood degree of drivers by 49.09% and 36.35%, respectively, compared to traditional smartphone-based music player under similar driving situations.;"[Hu, Xiping; Shen, Johnny; Leung, Victor C.

A debate is raging in the media as to the pros and cons of 'virtual-electronic' versus 'material world' active learning opportunities. However, when this scenario is played out with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australian children, it is even more contentious because the technological changes have resulted in shifting responsibility for teaching and learning of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander songs, dances and cultural heritage to a new physical and social environment which may distance musical development from community life. The rate of social change has been enormous, so in many cases there has not been adequate consultation and negotiation as to how early childhood professionals are to effectively implement the national Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF) (DEEWR, 2009) with respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander music culture. The purpose of this paper is to problematise the increasing distance of musical development away from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, and to propose new methods for exploring how digital technologies may be utilised for promoting children's musical development in various contexts. The findings are applied to early childhood practitioner recommendations for future community-led music research.;"[Kirkwood, Sandra; Miller, Adrian] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia";Kirkwood, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.;;;Miller, Adrian/0000-0001-9735-6609;;;;32;0;0;2;26;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1836-9391;1839-5961;;AUST J EARLY CHILD;Aust.

Objective: This study explores service users' experiences of music therapy in mental health care, and the potential role of music therapy in the development of recovery-oriented service provision. Methods: We conducted a qualitative meta-synthesis of studies examining service users' experiences in music therapy; included were 14 studies with a total of 113 participants. Both first-hand account of participants and the researchers' representations of such statements were taken into account in the analysis. Findings: A taxonomy of four areas of users' experiences was identified: having a good time; being together; feeling; and being someone. These core categories point towards music therapy as an arena that can be used by persons with mental health problems in their personal and social recovery process. Music therapy can contribute to the quality of mental health care by providing an arena for stimulation and development of strengths and resources that may contribute to growth of positive identity and hope for people with mental illness.

Unlike approaches that rely on music content and have been researched for almost two decades, music-context-based (or contextual) approaches to music retrieval are a quite recent field of research within music information retrieval (MIR). Contextual data refers to all music-relevant information that is not included in the audio signal itself. In this article, we focus on contextual aspects of music primarily accessible through web technology. We discuss different sources of context-based data for individual music pieces and for music artists. We summarize various approaches for constructing similarity measures based on the collaborative or cultural knowledge incorporated into these data sources. In particular, we identify and review three main types of context-based similarity approaches: text-retrieval-based approaches (relying on web-texts, tags, or lyrics), co-occurrence-based approaches (relying on playlists, page counts, microblogs, or peer-to-peer-networks), and approaches based on user ratings or listening habits. This article elaborates the characteristics of the presented context-based measures and discusses their strengths as well as their weaknesses.

One of the most challenging studies involves implementing a situation-aware personalized music recommendation service which considers the user's situation and preferences. Situation-aware music recommendation requires multidisciplinary efforts including low-level feature extraction and analysis, music mood classification and human emotion prediction. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for a situation-aware/user-adaptive music recommendation service in the semantic web environment. To do this, we first discuss utilizing knowledge for analyzing and retrieving music contents semantically, and a user adaptive music recommendation scheme based on semantic web technologies that facilitates the development of domain knowledge and a rule set. Based on this discussion, we describe our Context-based Music Recommendation (COMUS) ontology for modeling the user's musical preferences and contexts, and supporting reasoning about the user's desired emotions and preferences. Basically, COMUS defines an upper music ontology that captures concepts on the general properties of music such as titles, artists and genres. In addition, it provides functionality for adding domain-specific ontologies, such as music features, moods and situations, in a hierarchical manner, for extensibility. Using this context ontology, we believe that logical reasoning rules can be inferred based on high-level (implicit) knowledge such as situations from low-level (explicit) knowledge. As an innovation, our ontology can express detailed and complicated relations among music clips, moods and situations, which enables users to find appropriate music. We present some of the experiments we performed as a case-study for music recommendation.;"[Rho, Seungmin; Hwang, Eenjun] Korea Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Song, Seheon] Ajou Univ, Grad Sch Informat & Commun, Suwon 441749, South Korea; [Nam, Yunyoung] Ajou Univ, Ctr Excellence Ubiquitous Syst, Suwon 441749, South Korea; [Kim, Minkoo] Ajou Univ, Div Informat & Comp Engn, Suwon 441749, South Korea";Hwang, E (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Seoul, South Korea.;ehwang04@korea.ac.kr;Nam, Yunyoung/AAI-4536-2020;Nam, Yunyoung/0000-0002-3318-9394;MKE(Ministry of Knowledge Economy), Korea, under the ITRC(Information Technology Research Center)Ministry of Knowledge Economy, Republic of Korea [NIPA-2011-C1090-1101-0008];This research was supported by the MKE(Ministry of Knowledge Economy), Korea, under the ITRC(Information Technology Research Center) support program supervised by the NIPA (National IT Industry Promotion Agency) (NIPA-2011-C1090-1101-0008);;27;5;6;1;49;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1380-7501;;;MULTIMED TOOLS APPL;Multimed.

In recent years, a new research area of contextual music recommendation and retrieval has emerged. Context-aware music recommender systems are capable of suggesting music items taking into consideration contextual conditions, such as the user's mood or location, that may influence the user's preferences at a particular moment. In this work, we consider a particular kind of context-aware recommendation taskselecting music content that fits a place of interest (POI). To address this problem we have used emotional tags assigned to both music tracks and POIs, and we have considered a set of similarity metrics for tagged resources to establish a match between music tracks and POIs. Following an initial web-based evaluation of the core matching technique, we have developed amobile application that suggests an itinerary and plays recommended music for each visited POI, and evaluated it in a live user study. The results of the study show that users judge the recommended music as suited for the POIs, and that the music is rated higher when it is played in this usage scenario.;"[Braunhofer, Matthias; Kaminskas, Marius; Ricci, Francesco] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Comp Sci, Piazza Domenicani 3, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy";Kaminskas, M (corresponding author), Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Comp Sci, Piazza Domenicani 3, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.;"mbraunhofer@unibz.it; mkaminskas@unibz.it; fricci@unibz.it";Ricci, Francesco/H-3367-2012;Ricci, Francesco/0000-0001-5931-5566;;;;23;22;22;0;0;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;2192-6611;2192-662X;;INT J MULTIMED INF R;Int.

The students of music schools are a unique group of children and youths, because of specific loads on the organs of locomotion, associated with the playing of musical instruments. They can therefore be exposed to a variety of health problems, particularly in the case of insufficient physical activity. Objective: The aim of the presented study was to assess the level of physical activity of music schools' students on weekdays and weekends against the parameters of physical efforts beneficial to health. Method and materials: The study involved 225 musicians from the Katowice School of Music, Complex of I and II degrees, aged 10-18 years(138 girls and 87 boys). The level of physical activity was assessed on the basis of moderate to vigorous rates (MVPA). Results: Both on weekdays as well as at the weekends, boys presented a higher level of physical activity of at least moderate intensity (MVPA), which also resulted in a greater total weekly pro-health physical activity. Both boys and girls dedicated significantly more time to beneficial pro-health efforts physical health at weekends (p<0.01). The percentage of young musicians who meet accepted (in this study) standards for the optimal amount of physical activity in both groups was dramatically low (3.6% of girls and 11.5% of boys). Conclusion: Both boys and girls from the music schools often undertake moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at the weekends.

We selected low-level musical features which may trigger human emotions, based on TV music program's audience rating information and the corresponding music. In this program, audience was requested to rate music of the contestants and to select their preferred music based on their emotional feelings. In addition, we implemented personalized music recommendation system using selected features, context information and listening history. In the experimental results, we confirmed that selected features can be reliable features when these features are used in music recommendation systems.;"[Yoon, Kyoungro; Lee, Jonghyung; Kim, Min-Uk] Konkuk Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 143701, South Korea";Yoon, K (corresponding author), Konkuk Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 143701, South Korea.;"yoonk@konkuk.ac.kr; leejonghyung@hanmail.net; kimminuk@gmail.com";;Yoon, Kyoungro/0000-0002-1153-4038;;;;12;13;14;0;14;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;0098-3063;;;IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR;IEEE Trans.

In the recent years a new research area of contextual (or situational) music recommendation and retrieval has emerged. The basic idea is to retrieve and suggest music depending on the user's actual situation, for instance emotional state, or any other contextual conditions that might influence the user's perception of music. Despite the high potential of such idea, the development of real-world applications that retrieve or recommend music depending on the user's context is still in its early stages. This survey illustrates various tools and techniques that can be used for addressing the research challenges posed by context-aware music retrieval and recommendation. This survey covers a broad range of topics, starting from classical music information retrieval (MIR) and recommender system (RS) techniques, and then focusing on context-aware music applications as well as the newer trends of affective and social computing applied to the music domain.

Emphasis is placed upon career development. Standardized open-ended interviews were used to obtain rich and in-depth descriptions of the participants' experiences. Ten music therapists from six countries participated in the study. The themes that emerged from the data include moving from the ideal to the real world, shifting from the role of student to professional, confronting reality and working through challenges, and achieving personal growth and self-transformation. The dynamics of cross-cultural comparison, confronting the home culture, and redefining music therapy and professional identities within the local cultural context are illustrated via quotations from the participants.

Commencing in 1956, the choir performs in a cafeteria, patient wards, and outpatient waiting areas before each Christmas. With recent emphasis on oncology staff support needs the choir's relevance warranted investigation. This constructivist research examined what effect the staff Christmas choir had on the choir members and staff bystanders in 2008. Methods: Sampling was convenience and purposive. Staff choir members were invited to participate during rehearsals, and staff bystanders were invited at seven choir performances in the hospital. Respondents completed anonymous and semistructured questionnaires and the conductor (of 29 years) was interviewed. The inductive, comparative, and cyclic data analyses were informed by grounded theory and qualitative interrater reliability was performed. Results: Questionnaires from 64 staff were returned. The choir elicited positive emotions, memories, Christmas spirit, hospital community and/or work-life effects for many staff, in a cancer context described as sometimes overwhelming'' and stressful.'' Choir members' reactions included stress relief, friendship and feeling rewarded. Bystanders' reactions included feeling uplifted, inspired and moved. Suggestions for future performances were offered, including musical acknowledgement of other religious festivals. Two respondents were concerned about intrusive effects on patients and work practices. Discussion: A staff Christmas choir supported most choir member and staff bystander respondents in an oncology hospital and is recommended in comparable contexts. Further investigation is warranted to extend understanding about Christmas music's effects in palliative care settings.;"[O'Callaghan, Clare C.] Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Dept Social Work, Melbourne, Vic 8006, Australia; [Hornby, Colin J.] Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Therapy Serv, Melbourne, Vic 8006, Australia; [Pearson, Elizabeth J.

In this paper, we contributed in three distinctive ways to take into account the idea of context awareness in the music recommendation field. Firstly, we propose a novel emotion state transition model (ESTM) to model human emotional states and their transitions by music. ESTM acts like a bridge between user situation information along with his/her emotion and low-level music features. With ESTM, we can recommend the most appropriate music to the user for transiting to the desired emotional state. Secondly, we present context-based music recommendation (COMUS) ontology for modeling user's musical preferences and context, and for supporting reasoning about the user's desired emotion and preferences. The COMUS is music-dedicated ontology in OWL constructed by incorporating domain-specific classes for music recommendation into the Music Ontology, which includes situation, mood, and musical features. Thirdly, for mapping low-level features to ESTM, we collected various high-dimensional music feature data and applied nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for their dimension reduction. We also used support vector machine (SVM) as emotional state transition classifier. We constructed a prototype music recommendation system based on these features and carried out various experiments to measure its performance. We report some of the experimental results.;"[Han, Byeong-jun; Jun, Sanghoon; Hwang, Eenjun] Korea Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Rho, Seungmin] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA";Hwang, E (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Seoul, South Korea.;"hbj1147@korea.ac.kr; smrho@andrew.cmu.edu; ysbhjun@korea.ac.kr; ehwang04@korea.ac.kr";;;Korean Government (MOEHRD)Ministry of Education & Human Resources Development (MOEHRD), Republic of KoreaKorean Government [KRF-2007-313-D00758];This work was supported by the Korea Research Foundation Grant funded by the Korean Government (MOEHRD).

In order to provide personalized recommendations, the accurate modeling of user's preferences is required. Modeling of user's preferences needs their relevance feedback on the recommendations. The relevance feedback may be collected either explicitly or implicitly. The explicit relevance feedback introduces intrusiveness problem whereas the implicit feedback can be inferred from normal user-system interactions without disturbing the user. The users expect accuracy in recommendations and effortless assistance from the recommender systems. The multicriteria user preference ratings are useful to improve the accuracy of recommendations. However, collecting multiple ratings increases the cognitive load of the user. We believe that a combined, implicit relevance feedback and multicriteria user preference ratings, approach improve the accuracy in recommendations and eliminate the intrusiveness problem of recommender systems. In order to fulfill the above needs and to better understand the potential behind the implicit relevance feedback approach under multicriteria ratings context, this study focuses a new implicit-multicriteria combined recommendation approach. A Music recommender system is developed for this experiment to evaluate the recommendation accuracy of implicit and explicit feedback approaches under the user-based and item-based prediction algorithms against different data sparsity levels, training/test ratio and neighborhood sizes. Out of this experiment, the implicit ratings based prediction algorithms provide better performance than the explicit ratings based prediction algorithms with respect to all the three sensitive parameters. It is also observed that the proposed IB_PIR prediction algorithm computes better predictions than other prediction algorithms. Finally, we discuss the study's implications for theory and practice and conclude with many suggestions for future research on non-intrusive, multicriteria recommender systems.;"[Palanivel, K.; Sivakumar, R.] Bharathidasan Univ, AVVM Sri Pushpam Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India";Palanivel, K (corresponding author), Bharathidasan Univ, AVVM Sri Pushpam Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India.;"palani.avcc@hotmail.com; rskumar.avvmspc@gmail.com";;;;;;49;14;14;0;15;CALIFORNIA STATE UNIV;LONG BEACH;COLL BUSINESS, LONG BEACH, CA 90840 USA;1526-6133;1938-9027;;J ELECTRON COMMER RE;J.
