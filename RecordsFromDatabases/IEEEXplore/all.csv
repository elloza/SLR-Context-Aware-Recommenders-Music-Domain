In EBSNs, event recommendation is significant for users due to the extremely large amount of events. However, the event recommendation problem is rather challenging because it faces a serious cold-start problem: Events have short life time and new events are registered by only a few users. What's more, there are only implicit feedback information. Existing approaches like collaborative filtering methods are not suitable for this scenario. In this paper, we propose a Context Aware Matrix Factorization model called AlphaMF to tackle with the problem. Specifically, AlphaMF is a unified model that combines the Matrix Factorization model which models implicit feedbacks with the Linear contextual features model which models explicit contextual features. Extensive experiments on a large real-world EBSN dataset demonstrate that the AlphaMF model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 11%.","","978-1-5090-4470-2","10.1109/WI.2016.0043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7817060","event recommendation;context aware;matrix factorization;Recommender Systems;Event-based Social Networks","Social network services;Context modeling;Collaboration;Urban areas;Recommender systems;Context-aware services;Mathematical model","collaborative filtering;matrix decomposition;recommender systems;social networking (online);ubiquitous computing","linear contextual features model;AlphaMF;collaborative filtering methods;event recommendation problem;EBSN;event-based social networks;context aware matrix factorization","","10","","23","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The content information includes music textual content, such as metadata, tags, and lyrics, and the context data incorporate users' behaviors, including music listening records, music playing sequences, and sessions. Specifically, a heterogeneous information network (HIN) is first presented to incorporate different kinds of content and context data. Then, a novel method called content- and context-aware music embedding (CAME) is proposed to obtain the low-dimension dense real-valued feature representations (embeddings) of music pieces from HIN. Especially, one music piece generally highlights different aspects when interacting with various neighbors, and it should have different representations separately. CAME seamlessly combines deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms, with the embedding model to capture the intrinsic features of music pieces as well as their dynamic relevance and interactions adaptively. Finally, we further infer users' general musical preferences as well as their contextual preferences for music and propose a content- and context-aware music recommendation method.

Music lovers create music playlists for various contexts and activities they are engaged in, and this is done manually by updating and loading new playlist each time a user changes activity or context. This does not make music listening enjoyable as much time and effort is spent on searching for songs that befit the current context and activity. This paper proposes a personalized context-aware music recommendation system, called MPlist, that dynamically and automatically creates a music playlist for music lovers based on their context (i.e., current location and activity), listening preference, nearby users listening profiles, other users listening preferences and music from labels and tags mined from music experts and the web. MPlist collects data from multiple sensors in a user's smart mobile device and uses them to infer the user's context and activity, thereby generating a playlist based on contextual preference. This approach has the advantage of solving the well-known cold start problem yet giving music lovers a personalized anywhere anytime music listening experience. MPlist classifier is built using both kNN and rule-based learning algorithms using sensor datasets and context-aware listening profile dataset. The context-analytic engine infers basic user activities and sends all the inferred content to the content provider so that the server can learn the music preferences given a particular context. The system exhibit performance as follows: accuracy is 0.944, F-measure is 0.945, and RMSE is 0.0978. This tends to suggest that context-aware music recommendation systems is probably what music lover expect from music stores.","","978-1-5090-0706-6","10.1109/EmergiTech.2016.7737358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737358","Context recognition;sensors;smart devices;music;machine learning;data mining;mobile social networks","Music;Context;Recommender systems;Intelligent sensors;Smart devices;Mobile communication","data mining;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);music;pattern classification;recommender systems;ubiquitous computing","context aware music playlist;personalized context-aware music recommendation system;data collection;user smart mobile device;contextual preference;cold start problem;music listening experience;MPlist classifier;kNN;rule-based learning algorithms;sensor datasets;context-aware listening profile dataset;context-analytic engine","","1","","16","","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents our recent endeavor in collecting 5,502 real-life listening records with context annotation using Android smartphones in-situ. The user-provided context annotation contains labels selected from 10 user activity categories and 10 user mood categories.

Context-aware music delivery systems succeed in delivering suitable music according to the situation through the process of music mood-mapping which identifies the mood of a song. Additionally, we can leverage the power of the cloud to enable crowd sensing of the mood-mapping of various songs and enhance the effectiveness of situation-aware music delivery for drivers. The cloud can be used to aggregate the crowd sensed music mood-mapping data and improve the effectiveness of music delivery by providing accurate mood-mappings from the aggregated data. Currently, context-aware music delivery systems consider only features from the song for music mood-mapping. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to music mood-mapping for drivers which also incorporates the social context of a driver including age, gender and cultural background to enhance the effectiveness of music delivery in context-aware music recommendation systems for drivers.","","978-1-4673-9560-1","10.1109/CloudCom.2015.85","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396197","music mood-mapping;context-aware;cloud;crowd sensing;safe driving","Mood;Context;Vehicles;Sensors;Feature extraction;Labeling;Music","cloud computing;music;recommender systems;road accidents;road safety;traffic engineering computing;ubiquitous computing","context-aware music recommendation systems;situation-aware music delivery;context-aware music delivery systems;road safety;driver performance;road accidents;context-aware music mood-mapping;cloud-based crowd sensing approach","","1","","10","","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current music recommendation systems are facing two key challenges: (1) users' listening habits with respect to time haven't been well studied; (2) there are far less ratings than listening records in music providing systems. In this paper, we strive to address the above two challenges. We investigate when and what music will a user listen to, and we propose a Fine-grained Time-aware Music Recommendation (FTAMR) model. To be specific, we improve recommendation qualities from two sides: the user and the song. From the user's side, we study users' listening time-behavior in a fine-grained way and explore their short-term listening habits (e.g. in a day) and long-term listening habits (e.g. in several months); From the song's side, considering the sparsity of ratings and the characteristics (e.g., popularity) of each song, we define the asymmetric co-recommendation probability from a song to another, and cluster songs according to co-recommendation probabilities instead of similarities. Given users' listening records with time stamps, we make recommendation based on their listening habits and songs' co-recommendation probabilities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed FTAMR model, we study the Last.fm data set and conduct extensive experiments. The results show that our approach can provide better recommendations.","","978-1-5386-3790-6","10.1109/ISPA/IUCC.2017.00165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8367395","music recommendation;fine grained;time aware;listening habits.","Music;Recommender systems;Damping;Computer science;Collaboration;Standards;Probability","behavioural sciences;music;probability;recommender systems","short-term listening habits;asymmetric co-recommendation probability;cluster songs;time stamps;music recommendation systems;FTAMR;long-term listening habits;fine-grained time-aware music recommendation model;listening time-behavior study","","1","","25","","28 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While this practice protects users' privacy, it also creates highly sparse dataset, which in turn causes cold start problems in Recommender Systems (RS) and leads to poor prediction results. Contextual-aware recommender system (CARS) has been recognized as an efficient solution to address either a new user or a new item cold start scenario. It outperforms traditional collaborative filtering recommender systems. Most existing CARS solutions however have not provided efficient solutions for mixed cold start scenarios, in which two or more cold start problems co-exist. In this work, we introduce a Weighted Switching Hybrid Context-Aware (W-SHCA) Recommender System. It is based on two algorithms: Content-based CAMF-CC (Context-Aware Matrix Factorization) and Demographics-based CAMF-CC, and utilizes their weighted sum to perform the prediction when a mixed cold start problem is detected. We exploit the W-SHCA model in three recommendation applications: places of interest (STS), music (Music), and movie (CoMoDa). We illustrate some significant performance differences among these three datasets under various mixed cold start situations, and deduced a stable weight selection pattern for W-SHCA associating with dataset characteristics. We believe that this work is a pioneer in dealing with mixed cold-start problems, and would provide a vital reference point for their future research.","","978-1-5090-2403-2","10.1109/BigDataSecurity-HPSC-IDS.2016.54","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502323","content-based recommender systems;context-aware recommender systems (CARS);cold-start problems;demographic-based recommender systems;matrix factorization algorithms;and weighted scheme","Prediction algorithms;Recommender systems;Automobiles;Switches;Context modeling;Predictive models;Context","data privacy;matrix decomposition;recommender systems;Web services","mixed cold-start problems;privacy protection;Web services;CARS;weighted switching hybrid context-aware recommender system;content-based CAMF-CC;demographics-based CAMF-CC;context-aware matrix factorization;W-SHCA model;stable weight selection pattern","","4","","23","","4 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Music recommender systems can address these issues by recommending relevant and novel music to a user based on personal musical tastes. A typical scenario in music recommendation is that the music consumption is focused on some popular tracks and the most unpopular tracks are rarely accessed (i.e., the Long Tail problem). In this paper, we evaluate the impact of using context-aware recommender systems to recommend music in the Long Tail. We perform a set of experiments by applying three different context-aware recommender systems on three different real world data sets.

However, the music choice of a user is not only dependent to the historical preferences or music contents. But also dependent to the mood of that user. This paper proposes an emotion based music recommendation framework that learns the emotion of a user from the signals obtained via wearable physiological sensors. In particular, the emotion of a user is classified by a wearable computing device which is integrated with a galvanic skin response (GSR) and photo plethysmography (PPG) physiological sensors. This emotion information is feed to any collaborative or content based recommendation engine as a supplementary data. Thus, existing recommendation engine performances can be increased using these data. Therefore, in this paper emotion recognition problem is considered as arousal and valence prediction from multi-channel physiological signals. Experimental results are obtained on 32 subjects' GSR and PPG signal data with/out feature fusion using decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors algorithms. The results of comprehensive experiments on real data confirm the accuracy of the proposed emotion classification system that can be integrated to any recommendation engine.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2018.2844736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8374807","Emotion aware recommendation engine;emotion recognition;galvanic skin response;machine learning;physiological signals;photo plethysmography","Recommender systems;Engines;Feature extraction;Sensors;Skin;Biomedical monitoring;Physiology","emotion recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);music;recommender systems;support vector machines;wearable computers","emotion classification system;emotion based music recommendation system;wearable physiological sensors;music choice;historical preferences;music contents;emotion based music recommendation framework;wearable computing device;emotion information;collaborative based recommendation engine;content based recommendation engine;recommendation engine performances;multichannel physiological signals;PPG signal data;recommendation engines","","10","","25","","7 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Traditional recommendation methods make predictions based on long-term user profiles, i.e., the items a user interacted with in the past while ignoring the time and order of the interactions. Recent findings, however, suggest that users may exhibit interest to items in a certain order depending on situations and more recent items in a sequence have a larger impact on the subsequent choices. Moreover, in many practical applications, user-item interactions are organized into short sessions, where each session reflects the user's short-term interest in addition to long-term preferences. Leveraging both long-term user profiles and short-term sequential patterns from sessions can lead to more accurate models known as the session-aware recommendation methods. In this paper, we explore various strategies to integrate user long-term preferences with session patterns encoded by recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The strategies include integrating user embeddings with input and output of session RNNs, integrating with fixed or adaptive contributions of the user and session components by using a specially designed gating mechanism. We conducted an empirical evaluation of three publicly available datasets. The results indicate that combining user long-term profiles with the output of session RNNs yields improved predictions and the proposed adaptive integration model outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential and session-aware recommendation methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926074","Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8752213","Recommender systems;recurrent neural networks;session-aware recommendation;session-based recommendation;sequential top-N recommendation","Adaptation models;Recurrent neural networks;Recommender systems;Sports;Predictive models;Data models;Heuristic algorithms","electronic commerce;recommender systems;recurrent neural nets","neural session-aware recommendation;recommender systems;long-term user profiles;user-item interactions;short-term sequential patterns;session-aware recommendation methods;user long-term preferences;integrating user embeddings;session RNNs;e-commerce;recurrent neural networks;music websites","","3","","43","CCBY","1 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing studies highlighted the importance of worker recommendation for crowdtesting tasks in order to detect more bugs with fewer workers. However, these studies mainly focus on one-time recommendations with respect to the initial context at the beginning of a new task. This paper argues the need for in-process crowdtesting worker recommendation. We motivate this study through a pilot study, revealing the prevalence of long-sized non-yielding windows, i.e., no new bugs are revealed in consecutive test reports during the process of a crowdtesting task. This indicates the potential opportunity for accelerating crowdtesting by recommending appropriate workers in a dynamic manner, so that the non-yielding windows could be shortened. To that end, this paper proposes a context-aware in-process crowdworker recommendation approach, iRec, to detect more bugs earlier and potentially shorten the non-yielding windows. It consists of three main components: 1) the modeling of dynamic testing context, 2) the learning-based ranking component, and 3) the diversity-based re-ranking component.

To effectively recommend video content becomes a popular research topic. However, it has been found that existing recommendation methods based on video affective analysis ignore the temporal factor, leading to poor performance especially when the order of emotion components does affect the recommendation quality. This motivates us to study the feature of emotion fluctuation, which we call Temporal Factor of Emotion (TFE). In this paper, a novel recommendation method based on the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is proposed to tackle this problem. GRA preserves the temporal factor of objects during analysis and is suitable for analyzing systems with unknown correlation (a set of independent videos). In our work, first, specific video features are extracted and mapped to the well-known Lovheim emotion-space, through the SVMs (Support Vector Machine). Then, GRA is applied to compute the quantitative relation among videos by using extracted emotions as factors. Finally, a pick-filter pattern and GRA-based recommendation method under the Fisher model are proposed. To evaluate the performance of our method, an online video recommendation system is developed. Experimental results of both user study and parameter evaluation demonstrate that the GRA-based method can improve accuracy of video affective analysis and performance of video recommendation.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2017.2705341","National Natural Science Foundation of China; 973 Program; CERNET Innovation Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7930506","Video affective analysis;video recommendation;cyber-enabled application;cyber social computing;grey relational analysis","Hidden Markov models;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Semantics;Algorithm design and analysis;Collaboration","recommender systems;social networking (online);support vector machines","temporal factor-aware video affective analysis;cyber-based social media;industry;academia;video content;emotion components;recommendation quality;emotion fluctuation;temporal factor of emotion;TFE;grey relational analysis;independent videos;Lovheim emotion-space;SVM;support vector machine;pick-filter pattern;Fisher model;online video recommendation system;user study;parameter evaluation;GRA-based method","","5","","60","Traditional","17 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the key challenges in these systems are extracting dynamic context information and updating user's profile information. Recently by the popularity of IoT devices as well as the availability of the wireless network, a massive volume of data is available to gain useful insights into user profile which contains dynamic contextual information. IoT sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data, we need to understand them and use them in a context-aware computing platform. In this article, an adaptive context-aware service composition system is proposed using an IoT based social network dataset to find users' preferences, improve quality of experience, and boosts the personalization level of services. This paper proposes an 10T-based context-aware service composition to seamlessly find adaptive services offered by a service provider at anytime and anywhere. Firstly, the proposed system considers the dynamic social profile of the user and clusters their preferences while other systems take only static user interests into account. Secondly, this system increases the level of personalization by extracting context information from a user's IoT devices. Finally, the adaptive service composition provides users with various context-aware recommendation including movies, music, venues, radio stations, and events simultaneously. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed system, we target some of the smart objects such as smart watches/bands, smartphones/tablets, Google Home, and personal computers for detecting several contexts (e.g location, time, user activity, interest and e.t.c.). Experimental evaluations show that the proposed algorithm can improve accuracy and personalization of filtered items with compare to other widely-applied conventional filtering algorithms.","","978-1-5386-7266-2","10.1109/IEMCON.2018.8614780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8614780","Adaptive Services;Smart Objects;Sensors;Internet of Things;User Profile;Context Awareness","Motion pictures;Data mining;Filtering algorithms;Filtering;Internet of Things;Intelligent sensors","Internet of Things;recommender systems;social networking (online)","IoT sensors;social network dataset;service provider;dynamic social profile;static user interests;IoT devices;adaptive service composition;user activity;automatic context detection;intelligent systems;profile preferences;dynamic contextual information;sensor data;Internet of Things;quality of experience;personal computers;Google Home;tablets;smartphones;smart watches;smart bands;smart objects;user profile information;wireless network;context aware computing platform;context aware recommendation","","","","16","","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based models are widely used in sequential recommendation tasks with great success. Previous works mainly focus on the interaction sequences of the current session without analyzing a user's long-term preferences. In this paper, we propose a joint neural network (JNN) for session-aware recommendation, which employs a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and a RNN to process the long-term historical interactions and the short-term sequential interactions respectively. Then, we apply a fully-connected neural network to study the complex relationship between these two types of features, which aims to generate a unified representation of the current session. Finally, a recommendation score for given items is generated by a bi-linear scheme upon the session representation. We conduct our experiments on three public datasets, showing that JNN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on all datasets in terms of Recall and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The outperforming results indicate that proper handling of historical interactions can improve the effectiveness of recommendation.

It can aid us when we are feeling low and empower us. When we listen to sad songs, we tend to feel a decline in mood. When we listen to happy songs, we feel happier. Manual classification of songs based on mood, for making of a playlist, is time consuming and labour intensive. Our paper proposes a system `EmoPlayer', an Android application, which help to minimize these efforts by suggesting the user a list of songs based on his current emotion.

The cloud environment is dynamic and uncertain, which makes the quality of cloud services time-sensitive. However, most existing recommender systems did not take temporal influence into consideration, therefore could not accommodate the dynamic cloud environment. In view of this challenge, we propose a temporal-aware hybrid collaborative recommendation method for cloud service. It aims at providing users with appropriate recommendations from time-sensitive cloud services. In our method, by distinguishing temporal QoS metrics from stable QoS metrics, temporal influence is integrated into classical neighborhood-based collaborative recommender algorithm. Besides, to get an optimal recommendation, a temporal-aware latent factor model based on tensor decomposition is proposed and combined to improve the recommendation performance.

The emergence of online social network has enriched the user's information, realizing a new way to solve recommendation tasks. Social-aware recommendation algorithms can effectively alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the performance of recommendation systems. Despite the success of these algorithms, they have some common limitations. Most algorithms assume that social networks are homogeneous, with similar preferences among connected users. However, users may only share similar preferences in some aspects. Besides, different friends affect the user's preference in different levels. And this influence of friends on users' preference should be adaptive. Even close friends may have different influences in different decision-making processes. For example, a user may trust a friend in “travel” but distrust this friend in “music” because this friend had more travel experiences. Motivated by the above limitations, we designed a neural network model called adaptive attention neural network for social recommendation (ANSR) to study the interaction between a user and his or her social friends as well as infer the complex influence of the user's social relationships on the user's preferences. By utilizing the co-attention mechanism, we can not only extract the user's special attention to certain aspects of their friends but also determine the adaptive influences of different friends on the user. When the user interacts with different items, different attention weights will be assigned to the user and his or her friends, respectively. In addition, we also utilize network embedding to learn more efficient features of each user and incorporate these features into the ANSR to enhance the recommendation results. Moreover, we also conduct extensive experiments on four different real-world datasets and demonstrate that our proposed method performs better on all datasets compared with the state-of-the-art baseline methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2984340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9050750","Recommender systems;neural networks;attention;social influence","Neural networks;Task analysis;Collaboration;Deep learning;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Adaptive systems","collaborative filtering;neural nets;recommender systems;social networking (online);social sciences computing","social recommendation;data sparsity problem;online social network;social-aware recommendation algorithms;recommendation systems;decision-making processes;neural network model;social friends;social relationships;adaptive attention neural network;collaborative filtering;co-attention mechanism","","","","29","CCBY","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our proposed recommendation system relies on a novel algorithm which learns online the item preferences of users based on their click behavior, and constructs online item-cluster trees. The recommendations are then made by choosing an item-cluster level and then selecting an item within that cluster as a recommendation for the user. This approach is able to significantly improve the learning speed when the number of users and items is large, while still providing high recommendation accuracy. Each time a user arrives at the website, the system makes a recommendation based on the estimations of item payoffs by exploiting past context arrivals in a neighborhood of the current user's context. It exploits the similarity of contexts to learn how to make better recommendations even when the number and diversity of users and items is large. This also addresses the cold start problem by using the information gained from similar users and items to make recommendations for new users and items. We theoretically prove that the proposed algorithm for item recommendations converges to the optimal item recommendations in the long-run. We also bound the probability of making a suboptimal item recommendation for each user arriving to the system while the system is learning. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by over 20 percent in terms of click through rates.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2014.2365795","University of California; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940318","Recommender systems;online learning;clustering algorithms;multi-armed bandit;Recommender systems;online learning;clustering algorithms;multi-armed bandit","Context;Recommender systems;Clustering algorithms;Measurement;Scalability;Context modeling;Estimation","computer aided instruction;recommender systems;Web sites","online learning;large-scale contextual recommender systems;context-aware recommender system;cold start problems;item preferences;click behavior;online item-cluster trees;item-cluster level;recommendation accuracy;Web site;item recommendations;suboptimal item recommendation","","53","","33","","30 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we propose CDIA-Sim to predict users' preferences, which considers the impacts of the co-displayed items.

However, social recommender systems based on explicit relations are not as successful as expected due to the noise and the social cold issue of explicit social links. The intuition of utilizing explicit relations is that users share similar preferences if they are friends in the social network. In fact, quite a lot of users who are distant from each other in the social network also have similar tastes. The user item network and the user social network can provide useful information that can complement each other, so that exploring the implicit friends using the heterogeneous network they formed would be more helpful. In this paper, we propose an approach IFSR to discover implicit friends over the heterogeneous network to improve the performance of social recommendation. To find out reliable implicit ties, we first model the system as a heterogeneous network upon which both the preferences and social information are coupled. Over the HIN, similarities between each pair of users can be quantified through network embedding based representation learning. To reduce the computational cost while preserving the information embedded in the original networks and uncover the latent information hiding in the HIN, several meaningful meta-paths over the HIN are designed to guide the process of random walks. Finally, the Top-K implicit friends are incorporated into a social bayesian ranking model to enhance the performance of item ranking. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate IFSR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and illustrate why the implicit friends are advantageous for social recommendation.","2375-0197","978-1-5386-7449-9","10.1109/ICTAI.2018.00039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576037","Social Recommender Systems, Meta-Path, Implicit Friends, Social Networks","Social network services;Recommender systems;Heterogeneous networks;Bayes methods;Reliability;Noise measurement;Matrix decomposition","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems;social networking (online)","social information;Top-K implicit friends;social recommendation;implicit friends discovering;online social platforms;social relations;social recommender systems;social cold issue;explicit social links;user item network;user social network;representation learning;meta-path;social Bayesian ranking model","","1","","30","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"CPERS: Contextual and Personalized Event Recommender System","M. Wei; D.

Diversely from items in traditional recommendation scenarios (e.g. movies, songs), events in EBSNs are only valid for a short period of time, having no explicit feedback. Therefore the event recommendation problem is essentially cold-start. To overcome this limitation, CPERS combines content preferences and context influences derived from users' historical events. In particular, besides content preference based on events' description, CPERS exploits temporal impact from users' time preference, spatial constraints based upon geographical preference, cost consideration derived from expenditure history and social influence from social relationship between hosts and users. Furthermore, CPERS integrates the above factors to rank events for personalized recommendation. We collect a real-world dataset from a popular EBSNs called ""Douban Events"", and the experimental results on the dataset demonstrate that CPERS improves recommendation performance.","","978-1-5090-5510-4","10.1109/CSCI.2016.0086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881379","event-based social networks;content preferences;context influences;event recommendation","Context;Mathematical model;Recommender systems;Social network services;History;Feature extraction;Computational modeling","recommender systems;social networking (online)","CPERS system;contextual and personalized event recommender system;event-based social networks;EBSN;recommendation scenario;user time preference;spatial constraints;geographical preference;cost consideration;Douban Events","","","","16","","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using this platform, telcos can maximize their revenue potential by utilizing stored user data, an approach called data monetization. Mobile users equipped with a smartphone can use the Ericsson Implicit Social Networking platform through a myriad of context-aware services. After users install and activate a client application, they are able to receive personalized information, offers and content - e.g. movie recommendations, discounts for customer loyalty, songs and tickets for events by their favorite artist.

In the field of music information retrieval and recommendation, emotion is considered contextual information that is hard to capture, albeit highly influential. In this study, we analyze the connection between users` emotional states and their musical choices. Particularly, we perform a large-scale study based on two data sets containing 560,000 and 90,000 #nowplaying tweets, respectively. We extract affective contextual information from hashtags contained in these tweets by applying an unsupervised sentiment dictionary approach. Subsequently, we utilize a state-of-the-art network embedding method to learn latent feature representations of users, tracks and hashtags. Based on both the affective information and the latent features, a set of eight ranking methods is proposed. We find that relying on a ranking approach that incorporates the latent representations of users and tracks allows for capturing a user's general musical preferences well (regardless of used hashtags or affective information). However, for capturing context-specific preferences (a more complex and personal ranking task), we find that ranking strategies that rely on affective information and that leverage hashtags as context information outperform the other ranking strategies.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2018.2846596","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8382228","Emotion in music;emotion regulation;sentiment detection;ranking;music recommendation;microblogging;hashtags","Twitter;Tagging;Music;Task analysis;Recommender systems;Electronic mail;Data mining","information retrieval;music;recommender systems;social networking (online);unsupervised learning","unsupervised sentiment dictionary approach;affective information;latent features;ranking methods;ranking approach;latent representations;personal ranking task;ranking strategies;leverage hashtags;context information;affective hashtags;music recommendation;musical tracks;music information;musical choices;affective contextual information","","1","","84","IEEE","12 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The client is satisfied to receive any message she does not already have, with a satisfaction proportional to her preference for that message.

The proposed system detects the emotions, if the subject has a negative emotion then specific playlist will be presented that contains the most suitable types of music that will improve his mood. On the other hand, if the detected emotion is positive, a suitable playlist will be provided which includes different types of music that will enhance the positive emotions.

In order to the solve oversupply problem, we are breaking down the trade barriers between countries. However, in the future, it can be an era of breaking down individual trade barriers of a person and resolving oversupply of goods. This means that it will be an important issue in analyzing the characteristics of each person and providing the goods that match them. Music is an invisible and intangible product even though we can see this as a commodity as well, meaning that the music market is also a time period of oversupply because the paradigm has changed from analog to electronic music. In other words, the time it takes to make music has been shortened radically. After the paradigm shifted to the era of electronic music, the value of music streaming market exploded. In other words, it was a concept of music ownership in the past, but now it can be said that it has turned into a concept of approaching music. The market value of approaching concepts such as streaming is exploding. In order to overcome the oversupply problem and to recommend it, it is obviously a limit to distinguish music as the current profile elements such as genres, titles, and artists. So we work on classifying on of the greatest features of music: the lyrics. Since the lyrics of music consist of texts, music can be considered to contain human emotions because humans can convey their feelings in texts. We can use sensibility of the lyrics of music to classify music. We used about 11,000 lyrics based on the Billboard Chart from Hot 100. The Natural Language Processing (NLP) work was done to refine each of the lyrics, and the music was digitized as sentiment and emotion. After selecting a new song using the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm, we propose a method for recommending music with the most similar lyrics. In conclusion, we can inform users of songs with lyrics that are most similar to the overproduction of music.","","978-1-5386-5889-5","10.1109/SNPD.2018.8441085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8441085","data mining;text mining;music recommendation;emotion analysis;sentiment analysis","Classification algorithms;Crawlers;Text mining;Sentiment analysis;Electronic music;Tools","electronic music;emotion recognition;music;nearest neighbour methods;recommender systems;sentiment analysis","electronic music;oversupply problem;music lyrics;music market;emotion distance;sentiment distance;trade barriers;music streaming market;human emotions;Billboard Chart;natural language processing;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;music recommendation","","","","29","","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We measured strong increase of listening to a completely new artist in a few hours period after a friend compared to non-friends representing a simple trend or external influence. In our experiment to eliminate network independent elements of taste, we improved collaborative filtering and trend based methods by blending with simple time aware recommendations based on the influence of friends.

To achieve this mobile cloud computing service, after moving the computing capacity away from end devices to data centres (DCs), the converged infrastructure integrating optical metro and ubiquitous wireless access technologies is proposed in accordance with the 5G model. To minimize energy consumption, we propose a novel design framework of location-recommendation-aware virtual network embedding. This design framework determines the interdependency among user groups so that we can embed the virtual networks owned by user groups with a high interdependence into the same DC of the substrate optical-wireless hybrid infrastructure. Thus, the adviser can locally push the corresponding products to user groups at a single DC instead of consuming a large amount of energy to build inter-DC paths. The simulation results show that our design framework has greater energy efficiency and more profitable advertisement targeting compared with the benchmark, and the result of our heuristic is very close to the upper bound.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2580615","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Foundation of the Education Department of Liaoning Province; China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation Project; Liaoning Province Doctor Startup Fund; State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, within the Nanjing University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7491264","5G-based location recommendations;energy efficiency;optical-wireless integration;virtual network embedding;problem transformation;bound analysis","5G mobile communication;Energy efficiency;Optical communication;Wireless networks;Virtual networks;Bound analysis;Optical reflection;Social network services","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;computer centres;energy conservation;energy consumption;free-space optical communication;recommender systems;virtualisation","location-recommendation-aware virtual network embedding;energy-efficient optical-wireless hybrid networks;5G model;ubiquitous 5G wireless access;digital online social networking services;user preferences;location recommendations;advertisement targeting;mobile cloud computing service;computing capacity;data centres;optical metro technology;ubiquitous wireless access technology;energy consumption minimization;user groups;substrate optical-wireless hybrid infrastructure;profitable advertisement targeting","","14","","13","","14 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Trust is one kind of important information available in social networks and is often used for performance improvement in social-network-based RSs. However, most trust-aware RSs ignore the fact that people trust different subsets of friends pertaining to different domains, such as music and movies, because people behave differently in diverse domains according to different interests. This paper proposes a novel recommendation method called TruCom. In a multicategory item recommendation domain, TruCom first generates a domain-specific trust network pertaining to each domain and then builds a unified objective function for improving recommendation accuracy by incorporating the hybrid information of direct and indirect trust into a matrix factorization recommendation model. Through relevant benchmark experiments on two real-world data sets, we show that TruCom achieves better performance than other existing recommendation methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of TruCom.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2015.2427193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7114205","Collaborative filtering (CF);item recommendation;matrix factorization (MF);recommender system (RS);trust networks","Social network services;Linear programming;Motion pictures;Accuracy;Hybrid power systems;Recommender systems;Data models","Internet;recommender systems;social networking (online)","TruCom;domain-specific trust networks;recommender systems;information overload;online social networks;network-based recommendation;performance improvement;social network-based RS;trust-aware RS;diverse domains;multicategory item recommendation domain;hybrid information;matrix factorization recommendation model;recommendation methods","","16","","49","","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a first step toward achieving that goal, we propose a model that observes in real time the diversity brought by each item relatively to a short sequence of consultations, corresponding to the recent user history. Our model has a complexity in constant time, and is generic since it can apply to any type of items within an online service (e.g. profiles, products, music tracks) and any application domain (e-commerce, social network, music streaming), as long as we have partial item descriptions. The observation of the diversity level over time allows us to detect implicit changes. In the long term, we plan to characterize the context, i.e. to find common features among a contiguous sub-sequence of items between two changes of context determined by our model. This will allow us to make context-aware and privacy-preserving recommendations, to explain them to users. As this is an on-going research, the first step consists here in studying the robustness of our model while detecting changes of context. In order to do so, we use a music corpus of 100 users and more than 210,000 consultations (number of songs played in the global history). We validate the relevancy of our detections by finding connections between changes of context and events, such as ends of session.

Although the music listening behavior is a repetitive and time-dependent process, these methods have not taken this into account and only consider user-song interaction for recommendation. In this work, we explore the usage of temporal context and session diversity in Session-based Collaborative Filtering techniques for music recommendation. We compared two techniques to capture the users' listening patterns over time: one explicitly extracts temporal properties and session diversity, to group and compare the similarity of sessions, the other uses a generative topic modeling algorithm, which is able to implicitly model temporal patterns. We evaluated the developed algorithms by measuring the Hit Ratio, and the Mean Reciprocal Rank. Results reveal that the inclusion of temporal information, either explicitly or implicitly, increases significantly the accuracy of the recommendation, while compared to the traditional session-based CF.","2375-0197","978-1-4799-2972-6","10.1109/ICTAI.2013.120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6735331","Music Recommendation;Collaborative Filtering;Temporal Context;Listening Sessions","Context;Collaboration;Recommender systems;Mathematical model;Music;Vectors","collaborative filtering;music;recommender systems","music recommendation;session-based collaborative filtering techniques;temporal context;user-song relationships;music listening behavior;session diversity;user listening patterns;temporal properties;generative topic modeling algorithm;hit ratio;mean reciprocal rank;session-based CF","","22","","25","","10 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this arena, this paper presents a music recommendation system based on a sentiment intensity metric, named enhanced Sentiment Metric (eSM) that is the association of a lexicon-based sentiment metric with a correction factor based on the user's profile. This correction factor is discovered by means of subjective tests, conducted in a laboratory environment. Based on the experimental results, the correction factor is formulated and used to adjust the final sentiment intensity. The users' sentiments are extracted from sentences posted on social networks and the music recommendation system is performed through a framework of low complexity for mobile devices, which suggests songs based on the current user's sentiment intensity. Also, the framework was built considering ergonomic criteria of usability. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated with remote users using the crowdsourcing method, reaching a rating of 91% of user satisfaction, outperforming a randomly assigned song suggestion that reached 65% of user satisfaction.

It allows users to tag music items like songs, albums, or artists. Social tags are valuable to MIR, because they comprise a multifaced source of information about genre, style, mood, users' opinion, or instrumentation. In this paper, we examine the problem of personalized music recommendation based on social tags. We propose the modeling of social tagging data with three-order tensors, which capture cubic (three-way) correlations between users-tags-music items. The discovery of latent structure in this model is performed with the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), which helps to provide accurate and personalized recommendations, i.e., adapted to the particular users' preferences. To address the sparsity that incurs in social tagging data and further improve the quality of recommendation, we propose to enhance the model with a tag-propagation scheme that uses similarity values computed between the music items based on audio features. As a result, the proposed model effectively combines both information about social tags and audio features. The performance of the proposed method is examined experimentally with real data from Last.fm. Our results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to existing methods that suppress the cubic relationships that are inherent in social tagging data. Additionally, our results suggest that the combination of social tagging data with audio features is preferable than the sole use of the former.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2009.2033973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280358","Audio similarity;Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD);music recommendation;social tags;tensors","Recommender systems;Tagging;Music information retrieval;Information resources;Mood;Instruments;Tensile stress;Singular value decomposition;Information analysis;Taxonomy","identification technology;information retrieval;music;recommender systems;singular value decomposition","MusicBox;personalized music recommendation;social tags cubic analysis;music information retrieval;multifaced information source;three order tensors;higher order singular value decomposition;tag propagation scheme;audio features","","56","1","14","","6 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Collaborative filtering (CF) is an indispensable technique of recommender systems and widely applied in many areas such as e-commerce, social medium and review sites. However, CF suffers from three issues which are cold start users, cold start items and data sparsity. These issues severely degrade the recommendation performance of CF. To address these issues, we propose TrustTR, a novel memory-based recommendation model based on trust relations and item ratings. TrustTR integrates trusted friends' recommendations, item reputation and user history ratings to improve the recommendation performance. Especially, we calculate the user reputation based on trust relations and ratings information to supply the insufficient item ratings. Thus, TrustTR can alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the quality of recommendations for cold start users. Besides, we utilize item reputation as one of the recommendation factors to mitigate the problem of cold start items. Finally, the experimental results from a real-world dataset show that our method can produce better predictive accuracy compared with other five counterparts recommendation models.","","978-1-5386-0604-9","10.1109/NaNA.2017.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8247107","recommender system;collaborative filtering;trust relations;social network","Social network services;Data models;Predictive models;Recommender systems;Computational modeling;Collaboration","collaborative filtering;electronic commerce;recommender systems;social networking (online)","item reputation;user history ratings;recommendation performance;user reputation;trust relations;ratings information;data sparsity problem;cold start users;recommendation factors;cold start items;social networks;recommender systems;positive items;services;personalized preferences;information choices;collaborative filtering;CF;social medium;item rating;TrustTR;memory-based recommendation model;trusted friend recommendations","","2","","22","","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although current users are familiar with online music services, they have difficulty in deciding which tracks to listen to because there are millions of tracks available on such services. Automated playlist generation is one of the best solutions to solving this costly task of finding interesting tracks from the enormous tracks. Accordingly, one playlist-generation task, namely, hit rate, in which several tracks are given as a user query, is focused on in this study. There are four types of context objects (playlists, tracks, artists, and users) in the basic information on playlists, and three types of relations (playlists contain tracks and artists, users create playlists and artists play and/or sing tracks) in playlists. First, different types of relations in playlists are combined, and a single graph linking different context objects is generated. Next, a random walk is applied to the graph, and the expected values of track nodes are calculated on the basis of the transition probabilities of nodes in the graph. Finally, tracks are recommended in order of the expected values. The results of an experimental evaluation of the proposed methods in comparison with conventional methods revealed that one of the proposed methods (RW-hybrid) improved effectiveness by up to 21%.

The colossal development in the measure of accessible data and the increase in guests to the sites in the late years represents some key difficulties for recommender system. Today there is a major assortment of various methodologies and calculations of information separating and suggestion.

Recommender Systems (RS) is a known successful method for overcome information overload problem by filtering the relevant contents over the nonrelevant contents. Besides manage folksonomy information, STS also handle social network information of its users. Both information can be used by RS to generate a good recommendation for its users. This work proposes an enhanced method for an existing hybrid recommender system, by incorporating social network information into the input of the hybrid recommender. The recommendation generation process includes Random Walk with Restart (RWR) alongside Content-Based Filtering (CBF) and Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods. Some parameters were introduced in the system to control weight contribution of each method.

Meanwhile, manifold personal factors of users are also important for the problem, and research efforts have been made to improve the recommendation performance with auxiliary user information. As an important indicator of users' personal traits and states, the numerous social media content (e.g., texts, images and short videos), however, is still hardly exploited. In this work, we systematically study the utilization of multimodal social media content for music recommendation. We define groups of both targeted handcrafted features and generic deep features for each modality, and further propose an Attentive Multimodal Autoencoder approach (AMAE) to learn cross-modal latent representations from the extracted features. Attention mechanism is also employed to integrate users' global and contextual music preference with alterable weights. Experiments demonstrate remarkable improvement of recommendation performance (+2.40% in Hit Ratio and +3.30% in NDCG), manifesting the effectiveness of our AMAE approach, as well as the significance of incorporating social media content data in music recommendation.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206894","","Feature extraction;Social network services;Recommender systems;Videos;Visualization;Psychology;Image color analysis","feature extraction;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);music;recommender systems;social networking (online)","music recommendation methods;historical ratings;auxiliary user information;numerous social media content;multimodal social media;targeted handcrafted features;generic deep features;cross-modal latent representations;attention mechanism;AMAE approach;social media content data;music recommendation enhancement;attentive multimodal autoencoder approach;manifold personal factors","","1","","39","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This system suggests music to user depending upon the current emotional state of that person. Where the current emotional state of a person is calculated by measuring adjusted sentiment intensity value, which is an association of sentiment intensity value with a correction factor. This correction factor is based on user profile information and used to adjust final sentiment intensity value. Traditional classifiers are language specific and require much work to be applied to different languages. Proposed system uses a supervised sentiment classification approach for language independent sentiment intensity calculation. We train Naive bays classifier on our data and evaluate it on over 1000 posts in 2 languages, English and Malayalam. The supervised sentiment classifier with a correction factor can improve the performance of a proposed language independent music recommendation system.","","978-1-5386-0374-1","10.1109/I2C2.2017.8321803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8321803","Social Network;Sentiment analysis;Correction Factor;Recommendation","Sentiment analysis;Databases;Recommender systems;Dictionaries;Twitter;Education","Bayes methods;Internet;music;natural language processing;pattern classification;recommender systems;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","supervised sentiment classification approach;language independent sentiment intensity calculation;supervised sentiment classifier;correction factor;personalized language-independent music recommendation system;social media;internet services;human emotions;social network;language independent sentiment analysis;adjusted sentiment intensity value;user profile information;final sentiment intensity value;sentiment analysis;emotional state;language specific classifiers;Naive Bayes classifier","","","","17","","22 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, music recommender systems got in the focus of research in academia as well as industry. However, the standardization of the number of users listening to music has been directly used in decomposition of collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, which ignores the user listening to recorded tracks of the actual distribution and leads to failure to fully exploit this information for making the personalization recommendation. In addition, while music content analysis has been an active research topic for decades, the technologies are still in their infancy. The melody, rhythm, timbre and other important characteristics of the music is difficult to extract and process, as a result, the content features of music itself is not fully considered in most of the personalized music recommendation system for users, causing they are not satisfied for the music recommendation. In order to solve the above problems, our method RTCF (Tag-driven Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System), by analyzing the historical records of tracks of users in the data sets, we set up a reasonable scoring mechanism for users based on the training statistical language model (Good-Turing Estimate). In addition, we found that the tag has a related count when describing a song or an artist, which means that different tags can describe the characteristics of the track and the artist in varying degree. In combination with our analysis of the listening records of each user, the tags not only serve as additional information to broaden the content of the music but build the personalized music recommendation for users. According to the experimental results of users on the dataset containing tags, it indicates that our proposal method has a great advantage over other tag-based methods in making personalized recommended performance.","2375-527X","978-1-5386-8534-1","10.1109/I-SPAN.2018.00040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8636311","Social Tags Mining, Music Recommendation, Collaborative Filtering","Recommender systems;Collaboration;Music;Target tracking;Frequency estimation;Feature extraction","collaborative filtering;Internet;music;recommender systems;Turing machines","personalized recommended performance;music recommender systems;collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm;personalization recommendation;music content analysis;personalized music recommendation system;tag-based personalized music recommendation;tag-driven collaborative filtering recommendation system;good-turing estimate;RTCF;Internet-accessing smart devices","","","","23","","7 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This problem encourages many video hosting service providers to get deeper insight of the video data that they have and used them to give the best experience to the user. A video service provider such as Youtube will perform video analysis based on the internal video contents such as colours, textures, shapes, music signal, video title provided by users and other features that exist in video. The result of this analysis was used to understand its video content and also user preference on a video. At the last, an insight about user personalities can be known and video provider can personalize video for each user to give them best user experience. With technological developments in Machine Learning and Computer Vision technology, video analysis can be done based on other things beyond the video. It was the audience's impression of a video. An analysis of audience impressions in real-time was expected to get insights of a video content by a real feeling of the viewers. By those insights, a new video recommendation system can be built to deliver a new experience for the user in video discovery system. This system is intended to be able to deliver variative videos which match their personal emotion at the time. Based on this research results, 65% users love more than half in video list that provided by impression-based recommender system.","","978-1-5386-8079-7","10.1109/KCIC.2018.8628592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8628592","Recommender System;Video Labelling;Emotion Detection;Affective Computing","Streaming media;YouTube;Databases;Servers;Recommender systems;Measurement;Semantics","computer vision;emotion recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems;semantic Web;social networking (online);video signal processing","semantic video recommendation system;video viewers impression;video discovery system;video search function;user experience;video hosting service providers;video analysis;user preference;user personalities;impression-based recommender system;emotion detection;machine learning;computer vision","","","","9","","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The client is satisfied to receive any message she does not already have, with a satisfaction proportional to her preference for that message.

However, users would not hit an item if they cannot see it, or they are not interested in the item. Recommender system plays a critical role of discovering interesting items from near-infinite inventory and exhibiting them to potential users. Yet, two issues are crippling the recommender systems. One is “how to handle new users”, and the other is “how to surprise users”. The former is well-known as cold-start recommendation. In this paper, we show that the latter can be investigated as long-tail recommendation. We also exploit the benefits of jointly challenging both cold-start and long-tail recommendation, and propose a novel approach which can simultaneously handle both of them in a unified objective. For the cold-start problem, we learn from side information, e.g., user attributes, user social relationships, etc. Then, we transfer the learned knowledge to new users. For the long-tail recommendation, we decompose the overall interesting items into two parts: a low-rank part for short-head items and a sparse part for long-tail items. The two parts are independently revealed in the training stage, and transfered into the final recommendation for new users. Furthermore, we effectively formulate the two problems into a unified objective and present an iterative optimization algorithm. A fast extension of the method is proposed to reduce the complexity, and extensive theoretical analysis are provided to proof the bounds of our approach. At last, experiments of social recommendation on various real-world datasets, e.g., images, blogs, videos and musics, verify the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art work.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2019.2924656","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ARC; National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8745499","Recommender system;cold-start recommendation;long-tail recommendation;transfer learning","Recommender systems;Optimization;Business;Training;Iterative algorithms;Blogs;Videos","iterative methods;optimisation;recommender systems","long-tail recommendation;cold-start problem;user attributes;user social relationships;long-tail items;social recommendation;e-commerce systems;multimedia consumption systems;recommender system;cold-start recommendation;social data;Web systems;advertising systems;short-head items;iterative optimization","","1","","73","IEEE","25 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we first construct a text sentiment classifier based on deep learning to extract the sentimental texts from online reviews. After obtaining the sentimental reviews of musics, an algorithm is then proposed for extracting features of each song, which can be used to identify the sentimental information of the song.

The recommender system, which is able to timely select data of the interest to each individual user, has become the key to any successful business. However, currently most recommendation systems are based on a centralized architecture; nonetheless, they are not suitable for P2P environments. In this article, we propose a distributed semantic P2P overlay, which can provide music search and recommendation services by considering both of user preference and diversity of interests. We then propose a 3C hybrid recommendation procedure that adapts three traditional filtering techniques to fitting the requirements in a distributed semantic overlay. First, we choose a set of proper meta-data to represent a music object and use them to construct the characteristic-vector-based content filter. Second, a dominant attribute, which is one of the attributes in the characteristic vector of a music object, is used to build the profile of a peer. With the idea of the social network, a P2P profile-based collaborative filter is proposed. Finally, we explore the item-to-item relationship to construct a history-based cooperative filter. We use simulations and a real database called Audio Scrobbler, which tracks users' listening habits, to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system.

Thus, the necessity of delivering the most suited music to the listeners has been an interesting field of research in computer science. One of the important measures to deliver the best music to listeners could be their personality traits. In order to determine the personality traits of a person, social media like Facebook can be a useful platform where people express their views on different matters, share their opinions and thoughts.

Library data used for the Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) color model creation were: Hue to represent musical instruments, Saturation referred to tempo, and Value was key (pitch). Second stage was to create two types of graphical user interface (GUI) for color selection. The last stage was to collect data from 120 participants participating in the trials. This study focused on two questions. First was the accuracy rate of a recommended song that matched selected colors. Second was to find the most suitable GUI that provides the highest accuracy rate to the recommendation of songs. The tests were divided into two groups: test A and test B. As for test A, participants started a trial by choosing color from the application; while test B would start by selecting an initial emotion, and then choosing colors to match the chosen emotions. The results showed that the overall accuracy rate of test A is higher than test B and the slider GUI has the highest accuracy rate.","","978-1-7281-9978-8","10.1109/ICEAST50382.2020.9165455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9165455","color-to-music;visualizing sound;cross-modal associations;synesthesia;psychology of music;music cognition;emotional indicators","Color;Music;Graphical user interfaces;Image color analysis;Wheels;Instruments;Libraries","graphical user interfaces;image colour analysis;music","suitable GUI;highest accuracy rate;initial emotion;chosen emotions;Music recommendation;Color-to-Music application;preparation music library;library data;Hue;musical instruments;key;graphical user interface;color selection;recommended song;selected colors","","","","7","","12 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The recommendation system is deployed on the cloud, working with smartphones to deliver smart alarm sounds by considering not only sleep patterns, but also context information such as weather. The designed system can recommend smart alarm sounds to users, orchestrate sensing data collected by multiple sensors on smartphones, and collaborate with cloud computing to recommend preferable alarm sounds. An application is developed to demonstrate system effectiveness, which consists of the fore-end on Android OS and the back-end on the cloud.

With the development of social platforms, incorporating abundant social relationships into recommenders can help to overcome this issue, because users' preferences can be inferred from those of their friends. Most existing social recommenders are based on matrix factorization, a collaborative filtering model that has been proven to be effective. In this paper, we introduce a novel social recommender based on the idea that distance reflects likability. Compared with matrix factorization, the proposed model enables us to obtain a spatial understanding of the latent factor space and how users and items are positioned inside the space by combining the factorization model and distance metric learning. In our method, users and items are initially mapped into a unified low-dimensional space. The positions of users and items are jointly determined by ratings and social relations, which can help to determine appropriate locations for users who have few ratings. Finally, the learned metrics and positions are used to generate understandable and reliable recommendations. Experiments conducted on real-world data sets have shown that compared with methods based on only matrix factorization, our method significantly improves the recommendation accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2762459","Basic and Advanced Research Projects in Chongqing; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Graduate Scientific Research and Innovation Foundation of Chongqing; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8066292","Social recommendations;distance learning;collaborative filtering;matrix factorization","Measurement;Recommender systems;Matrix decomposition;Collaboration;Symmetric matrices;Training","collaborative filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;recommender systems;social networking (online)","matrix factorization;social recommender;latent factor space;user rating;social relationships;unified low-dimensional space;distance metric learning","","11","","38","","12 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid deep framework to solve cold-start problem of group event recommendation. Our framework incorporates multiple Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and conditional RBM. The former extracts high latent group preference from user feedback and group feedback.

Thus, the hybrid deep framework can utilize user feedback and contextual information of events to overcome cold-start problem.

Another challenge for MF recommendation systems is the accuracy issue when the speed of the new input data increases. The proposed RI-SGD is designed for computationally-efficient and accurate time-variant implicit feedback MF recommendation system, which consists of alternating least squares with weight regularization in the training phase and stochastic gradient descent in the updating phase. To demonstrate the advantages of the RI-SGD updating technique in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, we implement the proposed updating techniques in a real-time music recommendation system.

We use this well-organized structure in dimensionality reduction in user and item profiling. We compare two recommenders, one using our method and the other using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) in dimensionality reduction. The recommender using our approach outperforms the other. In addition to different dimensionality reduction methods, we evaluate the recommenders with different user profiling methods. Moreover, our approach collects personal interests (favorite movies and television series) from the Face book profiles. These user profiles are then used to find the similarity between users. At the end, items belonging to the most similar users' profiles and having a high score against users' profiles are recommended. Thus, we have focused on a hybrid system using tag-based contextual information of music tracks and user interests acquired from Face book profiles.

However, it is challenging to achieve personalized recommendations instead of offering up too many lowest common denominator recommendations. Understanding how products relate to each other is important because it has great impact on the performance. Furthermore, the personalized sequential behavior, which is closely related to a particular product, is essential for recommender systems. Most models simply integrate features from users and items without considering potential product bundle relationships between products exposed by users' personalized sequential behaviors. In this paper, a novel method based on Factorizing Personalized Markov Chain (FPMC) is proposed to comprehensively explore the latent bundle relations from users perspective, along with the hidden correlative semantics between products obtained from logic regression method, which provides a unified view to describe the user preferences, product/item features, and the user sequential patterns in timely manner. The involved semantic features are extracted using deep learning models.

Imagine an individual who tries to enter a social network through socialization. A key concern of the individual involves studying which other members of the social network he or she should interact with, so that the individual may gain the highest positional advantage, i.e., social capital. We ask the question: what ties to make with members of a dynamic social network for an individual who is trying to enter the network, to achieve a better position in the dynamic network? We formalize the dynamic social link recommendation problem. The focus of the problem is placed on modeling the evolution of social networks and the strategies for the target individual to create new ties with others. The result will be a recommendation mechanism that suggests potential members of the network whom the target individual could establish ties with. The goal is not only for the target individual to adopt the recommended output but the recommended output is beneficial to the target individual in terms of gaining a higher positional advantage. The main challenge in building such a recommendation mechanism is to identify potential links that are beneficial while taking into account the network dynamics. We aim to utilize multiple link prediction algorithms and propose edge establishing strategies to solve this specified problem. We evaluate these two sorts of strategies for average recall rate and average closeness centrality metrics, as well as other structural properties such as diameter, distribution of clustering coefficient.","","978-1-7281-5256-1","10.1109/ICSAI48974.2019.9010470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9010470","","Social network services;Training;Testing;Buildings;Predictive models;Indexes","network theory (graphs);recommender systems;social networking (online)","network dynamics;interpersonal ties;closeness centrality metrics;structural properties;recommended output;recommendation mechanism;target individual;dynamic social link recommendation problem;dynamic social network;social capital;socialization","","","","27","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Online music service providers are devoted to recommend personalized music to users, so that more users can be attracted by spending more money on their music service platform. Hence, an accurate recommendation for users is one of the most important tasks for the music service companies. This paper proposes a novel recommender system for recommending music. According to the preliminary measurement, we find that the interest of users on music changes over time. Furthermore, we notice that the time interval between two consecutive listened/sung musics can reflect the temporal interests of users. Based on these findings, we propose MusicRecLSTM, which leverages the attention mechanism and a modified LSTM network to learn the embeddings of both the user and the music based on the sequential data and the temporal context. MusicRecLSTM also learns whether a user would tend to listen to a newly released music at a specific time. Evaluations over three real-world datasets show that the proposed MusicRecLSTM can provide high precision, compared to several state-of-the-art recommender systems, with at least 20% improvement on the recall and mean reciprocal metrics.","","978-1-7281-4528-0","10.1109/DSC.2019.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8923736","Recommendation system;Deep learning;Neural network","Recommender systems;Music;Task analysis;Logic gates;Companies;Entertainment industry;Measurement","learning (artificial intelligence);music;recommender systems;recurrent neural nets","attention mechanism;MusicRecLSTM;personalized music;online music service providers;attentive context-aware music recommendation","","1","","26","","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we proposed a new group recommendation method, which combines topic identification and social networks for group recommendation. In detail, we firstly identify different topical sub-groups by topics in social networks. Secondly, different user factors are used to calculate the user influence (including individual and social) on the topical sub-groups, which can depict the topical sub-group characteristics in different points of view.

The objective of this system is to generate accurate recommendations in domains where users are looking for a more complete experience, in terms of joint item selections, and where the complexity of the related information cannot be evaluated and treated efficiently using the actual systems, like in the music playlist recommendations. In order to identify the underlying relations between songs, their styles and the artists that perform those, a hybrid Case-Based Reasoning approach combined with a graph model is used. This framework was designed with the scope to overcome the semantic gap present in multimedia recommendations, and at the same time, to be able to perform better in cold start situations.

Specifically, HKIPN propagates knowledge and user interest simultaneously in a unified graph combined by user-item bipartite interaction graph and knowledge graph. During the propagation, a hierarchical method is devised to aggregate a node's high-order neighbors explicitly and concurrently. Besides, an attention mechanism is employed to discriminate the importance of neighbors. Furthermore, due to information decay in the process of propagation, the decay factor, as the weight of each hierarchical representation to compose the final user-and-item representations, is taken into account. We apply the proposed model to three benchmark datasets about movie, book, and music recommendation and compare it with state-of-the-art baselines.

In this paper, we present a robustly co-learning model (RCoLM) that takes the incompleteness nature of KGs into consideration when incorporating them into recommendation.

At first, distinct from previous knowledge-aware recommendation methods, which mainly focus on transferring knowledge from KGs to item recommendations, the RCoLM attempts to exploit user-item interactions from recommendations for KG completion, and unifies the two tasks in a joint model for mutual enhancements. Second, the RCoLM provides a general task-oriented negative sampling strategy on KG completion task, which further improves the adaptive ability of the proposed algorithm and plays an essential role for obtaining superior performance in various sub-tasks of the KG completion.

As a popular technique in recommender systems, item recommendation works by recommending items to users based on their historical interactions. Conventional item recommendation methods usually assume that users and items are stationary, which is not always the case in real-world applications. Many time-aware item recommendation models have been proposed to take the temporal effects into the considerations based on the absolute time stamps associated with observed interactions. We show that using absolute time to model temporal effects can be limited in some circumstances. In this work, we propose to model the temporal dynamics of both users and items in item recommendation based on their life cycles. This problem is very challenging to solve since the users and items can co-evolve in their life cycles and the sparseness of the data become more severe when we consider the life cycles of both users and items. A novel time-aware item recommendation model called BiCycle is proposed to address these challenges. BiCycle is designed based on two important observations: 1) correlated users or items usually share similar patterns in the similar stages of their life cycles. 2) user preferences and item characters can evolve gradually over different stages of their life cycles. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of recommendation tasks by considering the inner life cycles of both users and items.","2374-8486","978-1-5386-3835-4","10.1109/ICDM.2017.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8215502","Item Recommendation;Collaborative Filtering;Life Cycle;Evolution Inference;Data Mining","Motion pictures;Collaboration;Bicycles;Filtering;History;Indexes","data analysis;recommender systems","BiCycle;temporal effects;recommendation tasks;item characters;time-aware item recommendation models;item recommendation works;recommender systems;life cycles","","2","","21","","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One area that is yet to be explored relates to harnessing the power of social networks as recommender systems. The idea that users may provide other users with recommendations that are more relevant than naive approaches is long known. However, the approaches currently implemented are based on the creation of simple relationships such as co-purchase of similar items. Similarly, video websites would like to suggest related videos to users to maximize the time they spend on their sites. Ergo it is crucial that sites like YouTube provide users with recommendations that are relevant to them. Moreover, given the large amount of videos on YouTube, a good recommender system may alleviate users' efforts on finding videos that interest them the most. Existing recommender systems for YouTube are typically based on finding similarities between the videos' textual features (video title or tags annotations) and matching these features to tags in the user's profiles or the videos they are currently watching. This approach is very limited because it restricts the users interests to the current theme of the video being played or the preferences in their profiles. This means that if one is watching a movie about football, it is assumed that the user would like recommendations on other videos about football. In this paper, we attempt to extract information about video relationship using a network formed from reviews left as comments in YouTube videos. We create a network of videos called YouTube Recommender Network (YRN) and use complex network analysis on this network as the basis of a recommender system. Our results show that our list of recommended videos is more diverse than the ones based on textual information. Our YRN provides diversity and captures other important characteristics such as high rating and most-viewed count.","","978-1-4244-8439-3","10.1109/SocialCom.2010.53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5591240","Social Networks;Complex Networks;Recommendation Systems","YouTube;Communities;Recommender systems;Feeds;Data mining;Facebook","information filtering;social networking (online)","recommender system;social network studies;law enforcement;marketing;video websites;video textual features;video title;tags annotations;user profiles;users interests;YouTube videos;YouTube recommender network;complex network analysis;textual information","","12","2","16","","30 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, users may have different interests for an item, and items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items, and tags. These data are modeled by a 3-order tensor, on which multiway latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using both the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) method and the kernel-SVD smoothing technique.

In this work, we propose two top-k link recommendation algorithms which focus on optimizing the top ranked links. For this purpose, we define a cost-sensitive ranking loss which penalizes the mistakes at the top of a ranked list more than the mistakes at the bottom. In particular, we propose a log loss, derive its surrogate, and formulate a top-k link recommendation model by optimizing this surrogate loss function based upon latent features. Moreover, we extend this top-k link recommendation model by incorporating both the latent features and explicit features of the network. Finally, an efficient learning scheme to learn the model parameters is provided. We conduct empirical studies based upon four real world datasets, i.e., Wikipedia, CondMat, Epinions, and MovieLens 1M, of which the largest network contains more than 70 thousand nodes and over one million links.

In this context, intelligent systems for music production aim to propose automatic tools to ease and support decision making by music actors.

It builds a user's profile as her historically interacted items, recommending new items that are similar to the user's profile. As such, the key to an item-based CF method is in the estimation of item similarities. Early approaches use statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Pearson coefficient to estimate item similarities, which are less accurate since they lack tailored optimization for the recommendation task. In recent years, several works attempt to learn item similarities from data, by expressing the similarity as an underlying model and estimating model parameters by optimizing a recommendation-aware objective function. While extensive efforts have been made to use shallow linear models for learning item similarities, there has been relatively less work exploring nonlinear neural network models for item-based CF. In this work, we propose a neural network model named Neural Attentive Item Similarity model (NAIS) for item-based CF. The key to our design of NAIS is an attention network, which is capable of distinguishing which historical items in a user profile are more important for a prediction. Compared to the state-of-the-art item-based CF method Factored Item Similarity Model (FISM) [1] , our NAIS has stronger representation power with only a few additional parameters brought by the attention network. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of NAIS.

Recommending potentially common friends is useful in practical applications such as finding potential partners between two business groups in commercial social network in order to expand their business range or to reach potential customers, finding common bus stops between two specified bus stops on traffic network etc. In this paper we propose a novel shortest path based common friends recommendation approach in OSN to find and recommend potential common friends between two users.

For instance, Netflix makes movie recommendations; Amazon makes product recommendations; and Yahoo! makes webpage recommendations. In these systems, items are recommended based on the characteristics and circumstances of the users, which are provided to the recommender as contexts (e.g., search history, time, and location). The task of building an efficient recommender system is challenging due to the fact that both the item space and the context space are very large. Existing works either focus on a large item space without contexts, large context space with small number of items, or they jointly consider the space of items and contexts together to solve the online recommendation problem. In contrast, we develop an algorithm that does exploration and exploitation in the context space and the item space separately, and develop an algorithm that combines clustering of the items with information aggregation in the context space. Basically, given a user's context, our algorithm aggregates its past history over a ball centered on the user's context, whose radius decreases at a rate that allows sufficiently accurate estimates of the payoffs such that the recommended payoffs converge to the true (unknown) payoffs. Theoretical results show that our algorithm can achieve a sublinear learning regret in time, namely the payoff difference of the oracle optimal benchmark, where the preferences of users on certain items in certain context are known, and our algorithm, where the information is incomplete. Numerical results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms (over 48%) the existing algorithms in terms of regret.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-2893-4","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854459","Recommender systems;online learning;clustering algorithms;multi-armed bandit","Context;Clustering algorithms;Recommender systems;Measurement;Motion pictures;Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;recommender systems","clustering based online learning;recommender systems;bandit approach;large-scale online services;movie recommendations;Netflix;Amazon;product recommendations;Yahoo!;Webpage recommendations;large item space;online recommendation problem;information aggregation;sublinear learning;oracle optimal benchmark","","6","","29","","14 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This raises the question of measuring the quality of the choices made by algorithms and their impact on the users. As a first step into that direction, this paper presents a framework to analyze the diversity of the information accessed by the users. By depicting the activity of the users as a tripartite graph mapping users to products and products to categories, we analyze how categories catch users attention and in particular how this attention is distributed. We then propose the (calibrated) herfindahl diversity score as a metric quantifying the extent to which this distribution is diverse and representative of the existing categories. In order to validate this approach, we study a dataset recording the activity of users on online music platforms. We show that our score enables to discriminate between very specific categories that capture dense and coherent sub-groups of listeners, and more generic categories that are distributed on a wider range of users. Besides, we highlight the effect of the volume of listening on users attention and reveal a saturation effect above a certain threshold.","","978-1-5386-9588-3","10.1109/SNAMS.2018.8554895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8554895","Network analysis;Tripartite graph;Diversity;Online music platform","Social network services;Security;Cultural differences;Measurement;Indexes;Bipartite graph;Search engines","information retrieval;music;social networking (online)","users activity;online music platforms;information ranking;content recommendation;social networks;algorithmic choices;tripartite graph mapping users;diversity score","","","","16","","2 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These approaches are agnostic to the song content, and therefore face the cold-start problem: they cannot recommend novel songs without listening history. To tackle this issue, content-aware recommendation incorporates information about the songs that can be used for recommending new items. Most methods falling in this category exploit either user-annotated tags, acoustic features or deeply-learned features. Consequently, these content features do not have a clear musical meaning, thus they are not necessarily relevant from a musical preference perspective. In this work, we propose instead to leverage a model of musical preference which originates from the field of music psychology. From low-level acoustic features we extract three factors (arousal, valence and depth), which have been shown appropriate for describing musical taste. Then we integrate those into a collaborative filtering framework for content-aware music recommendation.

Usually, researchers are looking for relevant papers using some search engines. Using a few keywords, one can obtain a list of similar works. Let us consider a situation when a researcher likes to find conference or journal where it is worth to publish. He or she receives many,,calls for papers” but most of them are not correlated with their researcher interests.

On the other hand, in dealing with the sparsity problem, community context information that is extracted from the social network containing all users is used for predicting unprovided ratings. As predicted ratings are not a hundred percent accurate, while the provided ratings are actually evaluated by users, we also develop a new method for calculating user-user similarities, in which provided ratings are considered to be more significant than predicted ones.

These systems have been introducing various recommender algorithms into their platforms to filter information from their voluminous databases. These recommendation engines help users to save time by providing them with results that suite their taste. Researchers and software engineers have developed numerous algorithms to recommend items more accurately however, very little research have been done on the scope of music recommendation using social data. Orthodox methods of recommendation utilized ratings supplied by users to each item as the basis of recommendation. The accuracy of prediction is significantly affected when ratings are not provided for some items or when the user is new to the platform and has not rated any item yet. It is also difficult to recommend new items that have not yet being rated yet. This problem is termed “cold start”. In order to eliminate this problem we propose the Collaborative Filtering (CF) using Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) and a Bayesian Nonparametric Model (BNM). A comprehensive experiment on music and social datasets from different source indicates a higher accuracy of prediction and performance.","","978-1-5090-3619-6","10.1109/ICBDA.2017.8078847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8078847","collaborative filtering;matrix factorization;Bayesian model;recommender system","Collaboration;Machine learning;Recommender systems;Data models;Data mining;Bayes methods","Bayes methods;collaborative filtering;Internet;matrix decomposition;music;recommender systems;social networking (online)","Collaborative filtering;probabilistic matrix factorization;web-based systems;video streaming;audio streaming;e-commerce;CF;PMF;BNM;cold start;social datasets;recommendation utilized ratings;orthodox methods;social data;music recommendation;software engineers;recommendation engines;voluminous databases;recommender algorithms;Bayesian nonparametric model","","2","","16","","23 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the context of recommendation, researchers usually evaluate the performance of a recommender system by holding out a random subset of observed ratings and calculating the accuracy of the system in reproducing such ratings. This evaluation strategy, however, does not consider the fact that in a real-world setting we are actually given the observed ratings of the past and have to predict for the future. There might be new songs, which create the cold-start problem, and the users' musical preference might change over time. Moreover, the user satisfaction of a recommender system may be related to factors other than accuracy. In light of these observations, we propose in this paper a novel evaluation framework that uses various time-based data splitting methods and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of recommender systems. Using millions of listening records collected from a commercial music streaming service, we compare the performance of collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based (CB) models with low-level audio features and semantic audio descriptors. Our evaluation shows that the CB model with semantic descriptors obtains a better trade-off among accuracy, novelty, diversity, freshness and popularity, and can nicely deal with the cold-start problems of new songs.","1945-788X","978-1-4799-7082-7","10.1109/ICME.2015.7177456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7177456","Collaborative filtering;content-based recommendation;cold-start;data splitting;evaluation metrics","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Silicon carbide;Encoding;Density estimation robust algorithm;Computational modeling;FCC","collaborative filtering;content-based retrieval;music;recommender systems","music recommendation evaluation;data evaluation metrics;semantic descriptors;semantic audio descriptors;low-level audio features;CB models;content-based models;CF;collaborative filtering;commercial music streaming service;recommender systems;time-based data splitting methods;user satisfaction;user musical preference;cold-start problem;computer system","","2","","24","","6 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We observe that our approach substantially outperforms the built-in Spotify Radio recommender.

Considering patients' heterogeneity in both illness and behavior, it is a great challenge to deliver personalized recommendations. Motivated by this healthcare application, this study incorporates patient choices and focuses on optimizing real-time personalized recommendation of physician assortment with limited resources, in order to satisfy patients' varying demands and improve the resource allocation efficiency. This work considers not only the influence of physician assortment to patient choice but also how physicians in the assortment are displayed on the webpage, i.e., the order of physicians. We adopt the location-based two-stage choice model to capture the patient behavior, in which patients randomly view the top physicians and then choose one among them. The recommendation problem is studied in both static and dynamic environments. In the static environment, we ignore resource capacities and optimize the recommendation of physician assortment as well as the displayed ranking. We propose a heuristic algorithm SORT for this static version of the problem and prove the lower bound of algorithm performance, along with the numerical performance validation. In the dynamic environment, we optimize the physician recommendations for a sequence of randomly arriving patients considering patients' heterogeneity in both matching degrees and choice probabilities. We propose a dynamic algorithm Adjust-exponential inventory balancing (Adjust-EIB) by incorporating our static algorithm SORT in the improved existing algorithm, which makes recommendation decisions based on the real-time remaining resources. We conduct a series of numerical experiments to compare our algorithm with several benchmarks. The numerical results show that Adjust-EIB outperforms the benchmark algorithms, especially in congested systems. We also conduct a case study with real-world data and verify the capability of our algorithm in improving real-world system efficiency. Note to Practitioners-This work is motivated by the increasing popularity of web-based appointment platforms. Considering the fact of limited physician resources, we address the issue of how to recommend physicians for patients in a personalized and real-time way on web-based appointment platform, in order to improve the matching degree between physicians and patients as well as the resource allocation efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, we propose one of the initial methods to recommend personalized physician rankings in dynamic environments with limited resources. We construct a specific model and propose algorithms to make physician recommendation decision, which performs better than other benchmark approaches based on the numerical analysis, and the case study with real-world system data indicates our method's capability of solving the practical problem. Our method is robust enough for the reason that the model allows arbitrary arrival pattern. The model and methods are specifically designed for the web-based appointment platforms, but it can also be easily applied in other application scenarios based on visual web pages, such as e-commerce.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2019.2950724","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8922604","Assortment planning;dynamic physician recommendation;patient choice;web-based appointment platform","Heuristic algorithms;Planning;Hospitals;Benchmark testing;Dynamic scheduling;Real-time systems","health care;information filtering;Internet;optimisation;probability;recommender systems;resource allocation","dynamic algorithm adjust-exponential inventory balancing;healthcare appointment platforms;adjust-EIB;physician recommendation decision;personalized physician rankings;web-based appointment platform;physician resources;benchmark algorithms;real-time remaining resources;recommendation decisions;improved existing algorithm;static algorithm SORT;choice probabilities;algorithm performance;heuristic algorithm SORT;resource capacities;static environment;dynamic environment;recommendation problem;patient behavior;location-based two-stage choice model;resource allocation efficiency;physician assortment;real-time personalized recommendation;personalized recommendations;physician recommendation services;patient choice","","1","","30","IEEE","4 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By using the listening environment, it is possible to recommend music lyrics that fit the atmosphere of a touristspot when the user enjoys the sightseeing. In this paper, the proposed method recommends the lyrics that fits the atmosphere of a tourist-spot by sharing the distributed representation beyond the domains of lyrics and reviews. The method uses a corpus of lyrics to build the distributed representation model, and both lyrics' and reviews' vectors are calculated with the model. As a result, the tourist-spot reviews are assumed to be types of lyrics. Based on the lyric-like vector representation of reviews, the similarity between reviews and lyrics can be calculated.

Such paradigms are based on either categorical or dimensional models. The interest in dimensional models has recently grown a great deal, as they define a semantic relation between concepts through graded descriptions. One problem that affects semantic descriptions is the ambiguity that often arises from using the same descriptor in different contexts. In order to overcome this difficulty, it is important to model and address polysemy, which is the property of words to take on different meanings depending on the use-context. In this paper we propose a Dimensional Contextual Semantic Model for defining semantic relations among descriptors in a context-aware fashion. This model is here used for developing a semantic music search engine. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we compare this engine with two systems that are based on different description models.","2379-190X","978-1-4673-6997-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7178054","music;information retrieval;polysemy;semantic contexts;music recommendation","Context;Semantics;Context modeling;Large scale integration;Computational modeling;Mood;Search engines","information retrieval;music;search engines","dimensional contextual semantic model;music retrieval;high-level music descriptions;musical content retrieval;musical content;graded descriptions;semantic descriptions;polysemy;use-context;context-aware fashion;semantic music search engine","","4","","22","","6 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the years, many automated recommender systems have been developed for social networking in order to help users find their communities of interest. For health social networking, the ideal source of information for measuring similarities of patients is the medical information of the patients. However, it is not desirable that such sensitive and private information be shared over the Internet. This is also true for many other security sensitive domains. A new information-sharing scheme is developed where each patient is represented as a small number of (possibly disjoint) d-words (discriminant words) and the d-words are used to measure similarities between patients without revealing sensitive personal information. The d-words are simple words like “food,'' and thus do not contain identifiable personal information. This makes our method an effective one-way hashing of patient assessments for a similarity measure. The d-words can be easily shared on the Internet to find peers who might have similar health conditions.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2012.2194717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184311","Health informatics;health social network recommender system;similarity measure","Vectors;Social network services;Communities;Internet;Semantics;Support vector machine classification","bioinformatics;indexing;information services;Internet;medical computing;recommender systems;social networking (online)","anonymous health condition indexing;similarity measure;online information service;automated recommender systems;health social networking;patient similarities;patient medical information;security sensitive domains;information sharing scheme;disjoint d-words;discriminant words;one way hashing","Abstracting and Indexing as Topic;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Autistic Disorder;Databases, Factual;Humans;Information Dissemination;Medical Informatics;Models, Theoretical;Social Support;Support Vector Machines","17","","19","","16 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper eradicates such an issue by using CNN. In order to obtain minimal processing, multilayer perceptron are implemented by CNNs. In comparison to various algorithms for image classification, CNNs observed to have little-processing. This implies that the filters used in CNNs are advantageous when compared to traditional algorithm. The visualization of features directly can be less informative. Hence, we use the training procedure of back-propagation to activate the filters for better visualization. The multiple actions such as capturing, detecting the emotion and classifying the same can all be confined as one step through the use of CNN. The slow performances of the real-time approaches could be enhanced by regularizing the methods and by visualizing the hidden features.

A key ingredient for successful recommendations is an effective similarity metric between two objects, and models that leverage the current context to constrain the recommendations. This work proposes a model for random object generation that introduces two key novel elements: (i) a similarity metric based on the distance between objects in a given object sequence, that is also used to measure similarity between meta-data associated with the objects, such as artists and genres; (ii) a hierarchical graph model with different graphs each associated with a different meta-data. A biased random walk in each graph that are coupled and synchronized dictate the random generation of objects, leveraging the current context to constrain randomness. The proposed model is fully parameterized from sequences of objects, requiring no external parameters or tuning. The model is applied to a large music dataset with over 1 million playlists generating a hierarchy with three layers (genre, artist, track). Results indicate its superiority in generating actual full playlists against two baseline models.","2643-6264","978-1-7281-4253-1","10.1109/BRACIS.2019.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8923630","graph model;recommendation system;similarity metric;music playlists;random walk;language modelling","Context modeling;Streaming media;Synchronization;Tuning;Music;Intelligent systems","graph theory;multimedia computing;music;random processes;random sequences","contextual hierarchical graph model;random sequences;music playlists;similarity metric;random object generation;biased random walk;random generation;large scale multimedia streaming services","","","","18","","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recommender systems solve this problem by searching through large volume of dynamically generated information to provide users with personalized content and services. Recommender systems are a computer-based method that helps the user by generating suggestions about new items and products. It does so with the help of the past ratings of the item or analysing the preferences of the user's friends in the social network. The recommender system is further optimized by considering the user demographics which further help in filtering the output. Recommender systems have a wide range of applications. It ranges from movies music, news, books, products to research articles, search queries, social tags, etc. This paper explores the different characteristics and potentials of two different prediction techniques which include Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering in recommendation systems in order to serve as a compass for research and practice in the field of recommendation systems.","","978-1-5090-4715-4","10.1109/ICISC.2017.8068649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8068649","Recommender Systems;Collaborative Filtering;Content-based Filtering","Recommender systems;Collaboration;Motion pictures;Correlation;Databases;Social network services","collaborative filtering;content-based retrieval;recommender systems","recommender system;user demographics;collaborative filtering;content-based filtering;recommendation systems","","","","9","","16 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In microblogging, hash tags mean some topic words between two '#', such as some social events or some hot topics. Hash tags can highlight the topic of tweets, and make tweets be easily searched and understood by others. Therefore, many users like adding hash tags for their tweets. Existing hash tag recommendation methods always consider semantic similarity between hash tags and tweets as the only key factor. However, the hash tags' user acceptance degree and development tendency are two important factors for evaluate the recommendation probability of them. In this paper, we propose a model for recommending some related hash tags for users to choose one or more of them as content added into forthcoming tweets. The above three factors have been considered to complete this task, which are the semantic similarity between a hash tag and a tweet, the user acceptance degree of the hash tag, and the development tendency of the hash tag.

Existing methods usually embed users with their temporal dynamics, which may have lost their long-term, intrinsic preferences. RNN is widely adopted to model users' behaviors for its expressiveness on modeling sequential information. However, RNN-based methods are insufficient to capture users' intrinsic preferences due to short-term dependency issues. In this paper, we aim to make progress from two perspectives: 1. extract users' intrinsic preferences from their historical behaviors more effectively and robustly; 2. explore a fine-tuning way to combine users' intrinsic preferences and external dynamic interests. To do so, we propose a modification of Dynamic Memory Network with gating mechanism for generating a dynamic, precise representation for individual users. We also design an automatic and implicit method, and it utilizes the intrinsic preferences as a trigger signal to search the input sequences and retrieves the temporal dynamics of users in the memory module. As a result, a desirable combination of temporal dynamics and intrinsic preferences is achieved. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have shown our model's superiority over the existing baseline method. Further analysis of the attention weights of each hop demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-1985-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8852311","sequential recommendation;dynamic memory;gating mechanism;RNN","Recommender systems;Memory modules;Logic gates;Context modeling;Neural networks;Motion pictures;Task analysis","collaborative filtering;consumer behaviour;human factors;recommender systems;recurrent neural nets","gated sequential recommendation;recommender systems;temporal dynamics;intrinsic preferences;RNN-based methods;short-term dependency issues;external dynamic interests;dynamic representation;precise representation;automatic method;implicit method;dynamic memory network;user historical behavior;sequential information modeling;input sequences;memory module","","","","38","","30 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate a method that uses information exploited from a user's online media sharing activities as a novel source of implicit feedback for recommendation system. We look into elements of media sharing behavior and suggest whether behaviors have the potentiality that could play a role as a predictor of users' preference. Then in a specific domain, we choose appropriate behaviors by two criteria: abundance and observability. As a representative case, we focus on YouTube, one of the most popular social video sharing sites. By criteria we suggest, we select three behaviors including favorite, upload and view and formulate the simple item-based algorithm based on those behaviors. Through a series of experiments, we evaluate recommendation results obtained from our dataset by comparison with those from other reference algorithms. The results show that favorite and upload have possibility to be used as implicit feedback.","","978-1-4244-8439-3","10.1109/SocialCom.2010.70","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5591286","recommender systems;collaborative filtering;social media;implicit feedback","Media;YouTube;Training;Prediction algorithms;Accuracy;Collaboration;Recommender systems","information filtering;social networking (online)","implicit feedback;collaborative filtering;recommender systems;music;book;movie;user behavior;purchase history;browsing patterns;watching habits;model user preference;user online media sharing activities;user preference;YouTube;social video sharing sites;item-based algorithm","","7","","23","","30 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since messages posted by microblogging users reflect their interests, and the keywords in the messages indicate their main focus to a large extent, we can discover users' preferences by analyzing the user-generated contents. Moreover, users' interests are not static, on the contrary, they change as time goes by. Based on such intuitions, in this paper, we propose a temporal-topic model to analyze users' possible behaviors and predict their potential friends in microblogging. The model learns users' latent preferences by extracting keywords on aggregated messages over a period of time via a topic model, and then the impact of time is considered to deal with interest drifts.

A successful online behavior recommendation system should have the ability to predict behaviors that users used to performs and also suggest behaviors that users never performed before. In this paper, we develop a mixture model that contains two components to address this problem. The first component is the user-specific preference component that represents the habits of users based on their behavior history. The second component is the latent group preference component based on variational autoencoder, a deep generative neural network. This component corresponds to the hidden interests of users and allows us to discover the unseen behavior of users.

Therefore, this paper proposes a micro-video recommendation system. The recommendation algorithms are the core of this system. Traditional recommendation algorithms include content-based recommendation, collaboration recommendation algorithms, and so on. At the Bid Data times, the challenges what we meet are data scale, performance of computing, and other aspects. Thus, this paper improves the traditional recommendation algorithms, using the popular parallel computing framework to process the Big Data. Slope one recommendation algorithm is a parallel computing algorithm based on MapReduce and Hadoop framework which is a high performance parallel computing platform. The other aspect of this system is data visualization.

This paper adopts a ”user ask, system respond” interactive way to obtain users' real-time requirements, and users are allowed to express their requirements on music in free text. In order to face the fast-changing music preferences, this paper adopts the bandit-based algorithm to absorb users' attitudes to the current recommendation, and the results show these methods achieve better performance than baselines.

Furthermore, link prediction on the obtained heterogeneous network enables association with (i) user information and their desired audio information; (ii) audio information and textual information that describes contents of musical pieces; and (iii) audio information and visual information that represents contents of musical pieces visually.

Through the Bluetooth transmission function, data can be transmitted securely with the mobile device. The EEG signal can provide a wide range of information about various cognitive dysfunctions and diseases. Further analysis of the EEG signal, classification and classification of depression level, in addition to providing medical staff as a reference for treatment, can also be used as an evaluation basis for music therapy. Therefore, this paper will implement a music recommendation system to provide users with a list of soothing emotions according to different symptoms and degrees. In music analysis, this paper will collect a variety of different types of music, through field verification and algorithm combination, to achieve a more robust depression music therapy recommendation system.","2575-8284","978-1-7281-7399-3","10.1109/ICCE-Taiwan49838.2020.9258021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9258021","","Depression;Electroencephalography;Medical treatment;Bluetooth;Recommender systems;Multiple signal classification;Headphones","Bluetooth;cognition;diseases;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;mobile computing;music;psychology;signal classification","cognitive dysfunctions;diseases;EEG signal;music analysis;emotional stress;psychological stress;brainwave signals;wearable devices;Bluetooth transmission function;mobile device;EEG Bluetooth headset;depression music therapy recommendation system","","","","8","","23 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Examples include purchasing products, listening to music, visiting locations in physical or virtual environments, and so on. There has been significant prior work in such contexts on developing predictive modeling techniques for recommending new items to individuals, often using techniques such as matrix factorization. There are many situations, however, where making predictions for both previously-consumed and new items for an individual is important, rather than just recommending new items. We investigate this problem and find that widely-used matrix factorization methods are limited in their ability to capture important details in historical behavior, resulting in relatively low predictive accuracy for these types of problems. As an alternative we propose an interpretable and scalable mixture model framework that balances individual preferences in terms of exploration and exploitation. We evaluate our model in terms of accuracy in user consumption predictions using several real-world datasets, including location data, social media data, and music listening data. Experimental results show that the mixture model approach is systematically more accurate and more efficient for these problems compared to a variety of state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2018.2832132","US National Science Foundation (NSF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8353141","Personalization;repeat consumption;mixture models;user modeling","Data models;Predictive models;Music;Mixture models;Social network services;Training data;Motion pictures","data mining;matrix decomposition;music;recommender systems;social networking (online)","matrix factorization methods;social media data;music listening data;products purchasing;consumption patterns;mixture model approach;location data;user consumption predictions;individual preferences;predictive modeling techniques;virtual environments;physical environments;music","","3","","35","","1 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the system, these two algorithms were compared over LastFM social music site data and by using tumbling windows. The better-performing FP-Growth was selected and used in creation of a real-time rule-based recommendation engine. Our most important findings show that online association rule mining can generate (1) more rules, (2) much faster and more efficiently, and (3) much sooner than offline rule mining.

However, unlike recommending usual items, such as movies or music, event recommendation suffers from severe cold-start problem, because most events in EBSNs are typically short-lived and registered by only a few users. Additionally, the available feedbacks for events are implicit feedbacks. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Deep Neural Networks Collaborative Filtering Architecture (HDNN-CF) that collaboratively makes use of the events' semantic information and users' implicit feedbacks for event recommendation. Specifically, we extend state-of-the-art method AutoRec to model implicit feedbacks by proposing Probabilistic AutoRec (PAutoRec).

In this paper, a novel technique is proposed for music signal analysis in the view of emotions, which is based on the orthogonal matching pursuit, Gabor functions, and the Wigner distribution function. The technique, called the OMPGW method, consists of three-level schemes: the low-level, the middle-level and the high-level schemes. For the low-level schemes, the orthogonal matching pursuit combined with Gabor functions is proposed to provide an adaptive time-frequency decomposition of music signals. Compared with other algorithms for signal analysis, the proposed algorithm can achieve a higher spatial and temporal resolution and give a better interpret of the music signal structures. In the middle-level schemes, the Wigner distribution function is applied to obtain the time-frequency energy distribution of the results from the low-level schemes. High-level schemes are used to describe the modeling of audio features, the procedure of music mood classification. A classifier based on support vector machines is utilized to model the extracted features with the proposed technique regarding the emotion models. Several experiments are conducted with four datasets, and better results are achieved with the proposed method. In music mood classification experiments, music clips are classified into different kinds of mood clusters, and mean accuracy of 69.53 percent on our dataset can be achieved using the OMPGW method.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2017.2724515","National Natural Science Foundation of China; CERNET Innovation Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7973014","Affective computing;feature extraction;music mood classification;orthogonal matching pursuit;time-frequency analysis;wigner distribution function","Feature extraction;Mood;Multiple signal classification;Time-frequency analysis;Matching pursuit algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Computational modeling","acoustic signal detection;audio signal processing;feature extraction;information retrieval;music;signal classification;support vector machines;time-frequency analysis;Wigner distribution","music signal structures;middle-level schemes;Wigner distribution function;time-frequency energy distribution;emotion models;music mood classification experiments;music clips;mood clusters;OMPGW method;feature extraction;automatic music mood classification;music-related applications;music retrieval;music signal analysis;orthogonal matching pursuit;Gabor functions;adaptive time-frequency decomposition;emotional expression;support vector machines;efficiency 69.53 percent","","1","","55","","11 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we analyze culture-specific music listening behavior based on a dataset of 2,724 Spotify users, 62,104 distinct tracks and 104,390 listening events by modeling users jointly via their musical preferences and cultural characteristics. By applying a density-based spatial clustering algorithm, we identify nine clusters which reflect similar users regarding both their musical preference and cultural background. Our findings show that cultural aspects cannot be approximated by GPS coordinates and that incorporating cultural characteristics allows for more precise user characterization.

The co-occurrence relationships between audiovisual features are derived for multi-modal latent semantic analysis. Then, given a video, a ranked list of recommended music can be derived from the correlation model. In addition, we propose an algorithm for music beat and video shot alignment to calculate the alignability of recommended music and video.

Aiming to overcome such limitations, we introduce a framework through which we extract dissimilarity features based on differences in preferences of items' attributes among users. We enrich the representations of items with the extracted features for the purpose of increasing the ability of a recommender to highlight the preferred items.

The proposed algorithm can be divided into two steps: the first step is to predict the preference of the unwatched items for each group members, which is a personalized prediction progress, then, it provides the recommendations for the group by aggregating group members' preferences, which mainly concerns the preferences of members who haven't seen the items. Without complex computation, the proposed algorithm can make accurate predictions of each item for group members.

This problem is well studied in different contexts such as item, document, music and movie recommendations. For the purpose of recommendation these systems store the context or the meta-data information about the item of interest (e.g. user rating for books, tags, price etc). However, the general approaches for finding relevant items for recommendation cannot be directly applied in the case when the context or meta-data information about the item of interest is missing. In this paper we describe an algorithmic approach to handle this problem of missing context for items. In the proposed approach we have extended the context of user's interest and developed an unsupervised algorithm to find the items of interest for the user. Finally the items are ranked based on their relevance to the user's interest. We study this problem in the domain of dataset recommendation where the meta-data information about the datasets is missing due to lack of coherent and complete repository for the research datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with real world dataset consisting of 20 user queries. We find that the proposed framework can recommend datasets for user queries with a recall of 90% in the top-4 recommendations. We also compared the performance of the dataset finding algorithm with the state of art supervised classification approach.

Such technology is motivated by the need for innovative applications such as searching, nonlinear access, and recommendation. Event detection over the timeline requires time-code level labels in order to train machine learning models. We use timed comments from SoundCloud, a modern social music sharing platform, to obtain these labels. While in this way the need for tedious and time-consuming manual labeling can be reduced, the challenge is that timed comments are subject to additional temporal noise, as they occur in the temporal neighborhood of the actual events. We investigate the utility of such noisy timed comments as training labels through a case study, in which we investigate three types of events in electronic dance music (EDM): drop, build, and break. These socially significant events play a key role in an EDM track's unfolding and are popular in social media circles. These events are interesting for detection, and here we leverage the timed comments generated in the course of the online social activity around them. We propose a two-stage learning method that relies on noisy timed comments and, given a music track, marks the events on the timeline. In the experiments, we focus, in particular, on investigating to which extent noisy timed comments can replace manually acquired expert labels. The conclusions we draw during this study provide useful insights that motivate further research in the field of event detection.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2018.2801719","European Commission's 7th Framework Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8279544","EDM;event;break;build;drop;SoundCloud;timed comments","Event detection;Music;Noise measurement;Training;Streaming media;Feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence);music;social networking (online)","online social activity;social media circles;EDM track;socially significant events;electronic dance music;temporal neighborhood;additional temporal noise;tedious time-consuming manual labeling;modern social music;machine learning models;time-code level labels;music track;temporally noisy labels;socially significant music events;event detection;manually acquired expert labels;extent noisy timed comments","","","","26","","2 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The service provider holds all the data, biases in the recommender algorithms are not transparent to the user, and the service providers often create lock-in effects making it inconvenient for the user to switch providers. In this paper, we argue that the user's smartphone already holds a lot of the data that feeds into typical recommender systems for movies, music, or POIs. With the ubiquity of the smartphone and other users in proximity in public places or public transportation, data can be exchanged directly between users in a device-to-device manner. This way, each smartphone can build its own database and calculate its own recommendations. One of the benefits of such a system is that it is not restricted to recommendations for just one user - ad-hoc group recommendations are also possible. While the infrastructure for such a platform already exists - the smartphones already in the palms of the users - there are challenges both with respect to the mobile recommender system platform as well as to its recommender algorithms. In this paper, we present a mobile architecture for the described system - consisting of data collection, data exchange, and recommender system - and highlight its challenges and opportunities.","","978-1-7281-4034-6","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060231","Social Networking Services;Ubiquitous Computing;Mobile Computing;Smartphones;Context Data;Device to Device Communication;Recommender Systems","Recommender systems;Motion pictures;Data collection;Google;Wireless fidelity;Computer architecture;Databases","mobile computing;music;recommender systems","music;smartphone;public places;public transportation;device-to-device manner;mobile recommender system platform;recommender algorithms;described system;data collection;data exchange;decentralized mobile recommender systems;centralized fashion;service provider","","1","","32","","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These products and services can be anything from books, digital content, music, videos, essentials, and more. Shuffling through numerous pages on the web may be hectic, that is where a recommender system may come handy in suggesting them products or services based on their past browsing history. The key motivation of this research is to improve the accuracy of existing benchmark model (Long-Short Term Memory with Multi Period - LSTM_MP) based on the previous purchase history. In the previous studies, limitations are seen in certain areas for e.g., usage of very less amount of data for evaluations due to which changing preferences of customers have not been identified. Also, they fail to accurately predict products properly. To overcome such shortfalls, researcher has come up with ALSTMM which is attention based Long Short-Term Memory Model which tells network where attention should be paid in input sequence of items corresponding to output sequence. The proposed model uses enormous and diversified real transactional data from Amazon, identifies changing preferences of customers over period and recognizes more patterns based on past purchase transactions. Our research focuses on suggesting a multi-time stamp product recommender system that is efficient enough to study past purchase patterns and accurately predict the next purchase order. With the help of RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) for time series data analysis, the model segments recommendation periods into numerous time stamps which can then be used by the system to recommend products. Several experiments have been performed using datasets from Amazon and Instacart, which reveal that this model is a substantially improved version of the older systems and excel in accuracy and diversity when compared to CF-based models. Based on the results shown at the end of this study, the proposed model is found to be best for multi-time-based product recommendation purposes. In terms of applications, this model can effectively contribute towards reducing the shopping times and manual effort.","","978-1-6654-0360-3","10.1109/ICCMC51019.2021.9418325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9418325","Recurrent neural networks;long – short term memory;sequence prediction;time series data;recommender systems;collaborative filtering","Time-frequency analysis;Recurrent neural networks;Data analysis;Collaborative filtering;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Data models","","","","","","30","","6 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inspired by self-attention's success in many NLP tasks, some researchers have employed self-attention in sequential recommendation to refine user representations by capturing the correlations between the historical interacted items of a user. However, the user representations in previous self-attention based models are not flexible enough since the self-attention is only applied on user side, restricting performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a deep recommendation model with feature-level self-attention, namely SAFrec, which exhibits enhanced recommendation performance mainly due to its two advantages. The first one is that SAFrec employs self-attention mechanism on user side and item side simultaneously, to co-refine user representations and item representations. The second one is that, SAFrec leverages item features distilled from open knowledge graphs or websites, to represent users and items on fine-grained level (feature-level). Thus the correlations between users and items are discovered sufficiently. The extensive experiments conducted over two real datasets (NetEase music and Book-Crossing) not only demonstrate SAFrec's superiority on top-n recommendation over the state-of-the-art deep recommendation models, but also validate the significance of incorporating self-attention mechanism and feature-level representations.","2473-991X","978-1-7281-1056-1","10.1109/ASONAM49781.2020.9381303","National NSF of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9381303","recommender system;self-attention;feature embedding;deep learning","Knowledge engineering;Analytical models;Adaptation models;Correlation;Social networking (online);Performance gain;Task analysis","","","","","","38","","24 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed link prediction algorithm predicts the links that are most likely to be formed in the network based on two new proposed metrics. These metrics take into account the effects of both the network structure and the attribute information of the items for predicting probable links. The links predicted can be presented as recommendations to the user. An item network consisting of item associations derived from the attribute information usually displays a community structure with items of similar nature being clustered together.

Social media is divided into subcategories like where one can share photos (i.e. Instagram, Flickr), video or music (i.e. Youtube, Last.fm), restaurant suggestions like Foursquare, or text like Twitter. Twitter is more of an idea and news sharing media than other types of social media and it has a huge amount of public profiles. These features of Twitter make it a more interesting and valuable media to research on. In this paper, we are addressing to identify topical authorities/influential users in Twitter. We provide a novel representation of users' topical interests called focus rate. We incorporate nodal features into network features and introduce a modified version of Pagerank algorithm which efficiently analyzes topical influence of users. Experimental results show that focus rate of users on specific topics increase their influence scores and lead to higher information diffusion.

Several applications, such as personalized multimedia recommendation or music genre classification, to name a few, benefit from tagging. Clearly, tagging aims at bridging the semantic gap between human concepts and content retrieval exploiting low-level features extracted from the multimedia. Here, the problem of personalized tag recommendation is addressed in a “query and ranking” manner on hypergraphs. This way, the relationships between the different object types, such as user friendships, user groups, music tracks and tags are captured and tags are recommended for a certain track to a user. Ranking on hypergraphs is studied by enforcing either ℓ2 norm regularization or group sparsity. Experiments on a dataset collected from Last.fm demonstrate a promising tag recommendation accuracy.","","978-1-4799-2890-3","10.1109/ISCCSP.2014.6877953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877953","Music Signal Processing;Tagging;Hypergraph;Group Sparse Optimization","Tagging;Vectors;Multimedia communication;Media;Optimization;Feature extraction;Tensile stress","graph theory;Internet;multimedia systems;music;query processing;recommender systems;social networking (online)","personalized music tagging;hypergraph ranking;hypergraph query;social tagging;social media sharing platforms;multimedia item annotation;arbitrary keywords;personalized tag recommendation","","","","19","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method cannot only improve the accuracy of the recommendations, but also reduce the running time. Furthermore, the Internet users may have many different interests. For example, they may be interested in sports videos, and at the same time also enjoy watching political videos.

Recommendation system is one of the effective means to solve the problem of information overload. However, the low-hardware configuration and limited computing capacity are common problems in most mobile devices, which make mobile computing applications face more and more serious challenges with increasingly strong demand for computing resources. Cloud computing, as a model of providing resources on demand, can provide technical support for solving the above problems. Recommendation as a service (RaaS), which packaged the recommendation system as a service, has attracted extensive attention from the business community and academia. In this paper, the RaaS model based on emotion analysis and double labeling is proposed. In this model, we make full use of commodity description information and user comment text to explore users' emotional preference on the commodity attributes that is less considered in the existing recommendation models or algorithms. First, we extract the keywords by analyzing the commodity description and user behaviors to establish commodity intrinsic attribute labels and user preference labels. Second, we mine the user's comments through emotion analysis to establish the commodity feedback labels and user concern labels. Finally, the recommendation results for users are generated by calculating the similarity of above four types of labels.

Thus it needs an efficient searching and filtering mechanism to choose the quality research papers, so that the effort and time of researchers can be saved. The recommender system proposed here uses three major factors used for building this system which includes datasets, prediction rating based on users and cosine similarity. The ratings are made by user which will be determined by the number of accurate ratings they provide. The results are then sorted by using cosine similarity.

Therefore, there have been a number of studies to identify user attributes automatically from SNS postings, since the postings reveal various attributes of writers. Many kinds of machine learning methods have been applied to automatic identification of user attributes as a candidate solution, but they suffer from two major problems. First, there are many postings in SNS that do not deliver any information about writers. Then, learning from SNS postings results in a biased model by these irrelevant postings. Second, the postings of a SNS user are somewhat related one another. However, most machine learning methods ignore this information, since they assume that data are independently and identically distributed. In order to solve these problems in user attribute identification, this paper proposes a novel method based on non-i.i.d. multi-instance learning. Since multi-instance learning treats all postings by a user as a bag and learns user attribute identification with such bags, not with postings, the first problem is solved. In addition, the proposed method assumes that the postings by a single user have a structure. By incorporating this assumption into the multi-instance learning, the second problem is solved. Our experimental results show that consideration of these two problems in automatic user attribute identification results in performance improvement.","","978-1-4503-2240-9","10.1109/ASONAM.2013.6785907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785907","","Support vector machines;Kernel;Conferences;Social network services;Learning systems;Accuracy;Educational institutions","learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","non-i.i.d. multiinstance learning;personalized recommendation;targeted advertising;SNS postings;machine learning methods;automatic user attribute identification;performance improvement;social network services","","1","","4","","10 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of biggest challenges of such a system is the implementation of unobtrusive device-to-device data exchange on off-the-shelf Android devices and iPhones. MobRec facilitates such data exchange, building on Google Nearby Messages with Bluetooth Low Energy.

Due to its capability and simplicity, collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most popular techniques for recommender systems. However, CF suffers from three issues which are user cold-start, item cold-start and data sparsity problems. These issues severely degrade the performance of CF. To address these issues, a hybrid collaborative filtering recommendation model, termed TrustCF, is proposed in this paper, based on user-item ratings and trust relations among users. TrustCF integrates ratings from trusted friends and similar users, ratings of similar items, item reputation and user history ratings. In particular, we modify the similarity calculation formula, considering the effect of the number of co-ratings. Trust relations among users are used to make predictions. In this way, TrustCF can alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the recommendation performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed TrustCF model and show TrustCF has better recommendation accuracy than other five counterparts.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-3180-5","10.1109/ICC.2018.8422329","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8422329","","Recommender systems;Collaboration;Predictive models;Social network services;Data models;Computational modeling;Sparse matrices","collaborative filtering;recommender systems;trusted computing","hybrid collaborative filtering recommendation model;trust information;recommender systems;information overload problem;positive items;CF;user cold-start;item cold-start;data sparsity problem;user-item ratings;trust relations;trusted friends;item reputation;user history ratings;recommendation performance;TrustCF model;recommendation accuracy","","","","12","","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

STSs consist of three main types of entities: 1) users; 2) items; and 3) tags. These data usually are represented by a three-order tensor, on which Tucker decomposition (TD) models are performed, such as higher order singular value decomposition. However, TD models require cubic computations for the tensor decomposition. Furthermore, TD models suffer from sparsity that incurs in social tagging data. Thus, TD models have limited applicability to large-scale datasets, due to their computational complexity and data sparsity. In this paper, we use two different ways to compute similarity/distance between tags (i.e., the term frequency - inverse document frequency vector space model and the semantic similarity of tags using the ontology of WordNet). Moreover, to reduce the size of the tensor's dimensions and its data sparsity, we use clustering methods (i.e., k-means, spectral clustering, etc.) for discovering tag clusters, which are the intermediaries between a user's profile and items. Thus, instead of inserting the tag dimension in the tensor, we insert the tag cluster dimension, which is smaller and has less noise, resulting to better item recommendation accuracy. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against a state-of-the-art item recommendation algorithm with two real datasets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2482458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7295613","Clustering algorithms;information filtering;recommender systems","Tensile stress;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Kernel;Semantics;Tagging;Taxonomy","computational complexity;matrix decomposition;pattern clustering;recommender systems;social networking (online);tensors","ClustHOSVD;semantically enhanced tag clustering;tensor HOSVD;social tagging systems;STS;three-order tensor;Tucker decomposition models;TD models;tensor decomposition;cubic computations;social tagging data;data sparsity;tensor dimension size reduction;clustering methods;user profile;tag cluster dimension;item recommendation accuracy;item recommendation algorithm;Last.fm;BibSonomy","","32","","33","","9 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We apply evolutionary multi-objective feature selection to measure individual contributions of different structural complexity features for each genre to feature sets with the smallest classification errors.

Motivated by a popular physician recommendation application on a web-based appointment system in China, this paper gives a pioneer work in modeling and solving the physician recommendation problem. The application delivers personalized recommendations of physician assortments to patients with heterogeneous illness conditions, and then, patients would select one physician for appointment according to their preferences. Capturing patient preferences is essential for physician recommendation delivery; however, it is also challenging due to the lack of data on patient preferences. In this paper, we formulate the physician recommendation problem based on which the preference learning algorithm is proposed that optimizes the recommendations and learns patient preferences at the same time. Since the illness conditions of patients are heterogeneous, the algorithm aims to make personalized recommendation for each patient. Besides demonstrating the effectiveness of algorithm performance in terms of regret bound, we also provide extensive numerical experiments to show the expected algorithm performance under heterogeneous reward scenarios and performance comparison with algorithms in the literature under fixed reward scenarios. We introduce the flexibility of adjusting preference estimate update interval into our algorithm and conclude that short update interval contributes to short-term performance while long update interval leads to good results in the long run. Furthermore, we analyze how preference bound helps the algorithm to make explorations, which constitute two major contributions of our algorithm. Finally, we discuss the relevance between patient preferences and physician utilization and present a utilization-balancing approach that is effective in numerical experiments.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2018.2839651","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8378251","Dynamic policy;patient preference learning;physician recommendation","Heuristic algorithms;Industries;Hospitals;Optimization;Artificial intelligence;Tools","health care;human factors;information filtering;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);medical administrative data processing;patient care;recommender systems","dynamic recommendation;physician assortment;patient preference;physician recommendation problem;personalized recommendation;physician recommendation delivery;preference learning algorithm;preference estimate update interval;physician utilization;physician recommendation application;Web-based appointment system;utilization-balancing approach","","1","","30","","11 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The types of information are diversified and abundant in recommendation systems; therefore the proportion of unstructured multimodal data such as text, image, and video is increasing. However, due to the representation gap between different modalities, it is intractable to effectively use unstructured multimodal data to improve the efficiency of recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multimodal interest-related item similarity model (multimodal IRIS) to provide recommendations based on the multimodal data source. Specifically, the multimodal IRIS model consists of three modules, i.e., multimodal feature learning module, the interest-related network (IRN) module, and item similarity recommendation module. The multimodal feature learning module adds knowledge sharing unit among different modalities. Then, IRN learns the interest relevance between target item and different historical items respectively. Finally, the multimodal feature learning, IRN, and item similarity recommendation modules are unified into an integrated system to achieve performance enhancements and to accommodate the addition or absence of different modal data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, by dealing with the multimodal data which people may pay more attention to when selecting items, the proposed multimodal IRIS significantly improves accuracy and interpretability on top-N recommendation task over the state-of-the-art methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2893355","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds of Ministry of Education and China Mobile; ISN State Key Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8618448","Top-N recommendation;multimodal data;multimodal interest-related item similarity;knowledge sharing unit","Visualization;Task analysis;Motion pictures;Deep learning;Feature extraction;Data models;Iris recognition","feature extraction;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems","interest relevance;target item;item similarity recommendation module;integrated system;top-N recommendation task;recommendation systems;social networking sites;unstructured multimodal data;end-to-end multimodal interest-related item similarity model;multimodal data source;multimodal IRIS model;multimodal feature learning module;interest-related network module;historical items","","2","","45","","18 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As more users are joining these online consumer and entertainment sectors, the profile-based data for providing accurate just-in-time recommendations is rising thanks to strategies based on collaborative filtering or content-based metrics. However, these systems merely focus on providing the right item for the users without taking into account what would be the best strategy to suggest the movie, the product or the song (i.e. the strategy to increase the success or impact of the recommendation). Taking this research gap into consideration, this paper proposes a profile-based recommendation system that outputs a set of potential persuasive strategies that can be used with users with similar characteristics. The scope of the tailored persuasive strategies is to make office-based employees of tertiary buildings increase their pro-environmental awareness and enhance the energy efficiency at work (the dataset used on this research is specific of this sector).

Unfortunately, both relationship feature data and label data are very sparse in real social platforms like WeChat, rendering existing methods inapplicable. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of WeChat relationships to identify the major challenges for the relationship classification task. To tackle the challenges, we propose a Local Community-based Edge Classification (LoCEC) framework that classifies user relationships in a social network into real-world social connection types. LoCEC enforces a three-phase processing, namely local community detection, community classification and relationship classification, to address the sparsity issue of relationship features and relationship labels.

In recent times recommender systems, recommend everything from movies, books, music, restaurant, news to jokes. Collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms are one of the most successful recommendation techniques which present information on items and products that are according to user's interest. There are two methods in CF, user-based CF and item-based CF. Former finds a certain user's interests by finding other users who have similar interests whereas item based CF looks into a set of items rated by all users and computes how similar they are to the target item under recommendation. This paper aims to develop a model by splitting the costly computations in CF algorithms into three Map-Reduce phases. Further, each of these phases can be executed independently on different nodes in parallel. To compute the similarity, the Pearson correlation algorithm is used, which measures the how two items linearly relate to each other, giving a value between -1 and +1 inclusive. In addition, this paper compares the implementation of item based and user based CF algorithm on map-reduce framework. Experimental results showed that the running time of the algorithm improves by approximately 30% with every addition of a node, into a Hadoop cluster.

We apply this support system to improve the specificity of breast cancer screening and diagnosis. The system utilizes clinical context (e.g., demographics, medical history) to minimize the false positive rates while avoiding false negatives. An online contextual learning algorithm is used to update the diagnostic strategy presented to the physicians over time. We analytically evaluate the diagnostic performance loss of the proposed algorithm, in which the true patient distribution is not known and needs to be learned, as compared with the optimal strategy where all information is assumed known, and prove that the false positive rate of the proposed learning algorithm asymptotically converges to the optimum. In addition, our algorithm also has the important merit that it can provide individualized confidence estimates about the accuracy of the diagnosis recommendation. Moreover, the relevancy of contextual features is assessed, enabling the approach to identify specific contextual features that provide the most value of information in reducing diagnostic errors.

Consequently, the design of personalized user interfaces and music recommender systems might benefit from understanding the relationship between personality and use of social media. Since there has not been a study between personality and use of Twitter at large, we set out to analyze the relationship between personality and different types of Twitter users, including popular users and influentials. For 335 users, we gather personality data, analyze it, and find that both popular users and influentials are extroverts and emotionally stable (low in the trait of Neuroticism). Interestingly, we also find that popular users are `imaginative' (high in Openness), while influentials tend to be `organized' (high in Conscientiousness). We then show a way of accurately predicting a user's personality simply based on three counts publicly available on profiles: following, followers, and listed counts. Knowing these three quantities about an active user, one can predict the user's five personality traits with a root-mean-squared error below 0.88 on a [1,5] scale. Based on these promising results, we argue that being able to predict user personality goes well beyond our initial goal of informing the design of new personalized applications as it, for example, expands current studies on privacy in social media.","","978-1-4577-1931-8","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113111","Web 2.0;Personality;Social Networks;Twitter","Conferences;Privacy;Social network services;Security","data analysis;social networking (online);user interfaces","Twitter profile;psychological personality prediction;personalized user interface;music recommender system;social media;Twitter user;personality data analysis;neuroticism trait;openness trait;conscientiousness trait;user personality","","174","1","41","","2 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results reveal that the interest similarity follows the homophily principle. Particularly, the results show that two users are more likely to be alike in their interests 1) if they exhibit more similarity in their demographic characteristics (e.g., similar age, same gender, or close to each other geographically), or 2) if they are more intimate in their friendship, or 3) if they present a higher average interest individuality (i.e., a measurement for estimating the personalized characteristics of a user's interests).

Previous works mainly focus on the prediction task independently, which predict either the links between users or the links between users and items. However, these two prediction tasks are always coupled with each other, where users' preferences will influence the formation of users' interaction in coupled social networks, and vice versa. In this paper, we proposed a multitasking factor graph model (MFG) for predicting the user interaction and links between users and items simultaneously. Firstly, we observed some interesting network transfer structures according to the feature analysis between the user-user network and user-item network. Sequently, we developed a MFG model based on these network transfer structure, which can transfer information mutually from one network to the other to solve the multitasking prediction problem.

Collaborative filtering algorithms are widely used in many online systems. Often, the computation of these recommender systems is performed on a central server, controlled by the provider, requiring constant internet connection for gathering and computing data. However, in many scenarios, such constraints cannot be guaranteed or may not even be desired. This work proposes a recommendation engine where users share information via an opportunistic network independent of a dedicated internet connection. In this framework, each node is responsible for gathering information from nearby nodes and calculating its own recommendations. Using a centralized collaborative filtering recommender as a baseline, we evaluate three simulated scenarios composed by different movement speeds and data exchange parameters. Our results show that in a relatively short time, an opportunistic distributed recommender systems can achieve results similar to a traditional central system. Our analysis shows that the speed at which the opportunistic recommender system stabilizes depends on several factors including density of the users, movement speed and patterns of the users, and transmission strategies.","2332-5658","978-1-5386-2195-0","10.1109/AINA.2018.00049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8432251","opportunistic networks;recommender systems;mobile ad hoc networks","Recommender systems;Collaboration;Servers;Metadata;Music;Device-to-device communication;Wireless fidelity","collaborative filtering;information filtering;Internet;recommender systems","simulated scenarios;data exchange parameters;opportunistic distributed recommender systems;traditional central system;distributed user-based collaborative filtering;opportunistic distributed network;collaborative filtering algorithms;online systems;central server;constant internet connection;computing data;recommendation engine;users share information;opportunistic network independent;dedicated internet connection;centralized collaborative filtering recommender;movement speeds","","2","","40","","13 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In LBSNs, identifying home locations of users is very important for various applications like effective location-based advertisement and recommendation. However, this problem is rather challenging because the location information in LBSNs is sparse and noisy: Only a small percentage of users share their home location information due to privacy concerns; users may check in at diverse places far from their home and make friends far away; many users even do not have any check-in information. In this paper, we propose a trust-based influence model, named as TSU to solve the problem. To be specific, TSU is a Trust-based unified probabilistic model that models edges in LBSNs based on signals from Social relationship data(social friendship, social trust) and User-centric data(check-in data) in LBSN.

Thus, the previously consumed items are usually out of consideration due to the “lack” of novelty. However, as time elapses, people may forget those previously consumed and preferred items which could become “novel” again. Meanwhile, repeat consumption accounts for a major portion of people's observed activities; examples include: eating regularly at a same restaurant, or repeatedly listening to the same songs. Therefore, we believe that recommending repeat consumption will have a real utility at certain times. In this paper, we formulate the problem of recommendation for repeat consumption with user implicit feedback. A time-sensitive personalized pairwise ranking (TS-PPR) method based on user behavioral features is proposed to address this problem. The proposed method factorizes the temporal user-item interactions via learning the mappings from the behavioral features in observable space to the preference features in latent space, and combines users' static and dynamic preferences together in recommendation.

An improved collaborative filtering algorithm is proposed for solving the problem that the relationship between recommendation time as well as accuracy cannot be weighed and how to protect user privacy. In this paper, the matrix dimension reduction technique of locally optimized singular value decomposition(SVD) and the K-means clustering technique are used to reduce the dimensions and cluster similar users in the user-item scoring matrix. The approximate difference matrix is used to represent the local structure of the scoring matrix to implement the local optimization. The locally optimized SVD technique can alleviate the problem of data sparsity and poor scalability in collaborative filtering by using fewer iterations. K-means clustering technique can greatly narrow the search range of neighbor sets and improve the recommendation speed. Therefore, collaborative filtering algorithms based on dimensionality reduction and clustering can generate recommendations in an accurate and real-time manner. The experimental results on the MovieLens dataset show that the algorithm can reduce the impact of data sparsity, protect user privacy and effectively improve the accuracy of recommendation.","","978-1-7281-1973-1","10.1109/ComComAp46287.2019.9018779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9018779","collaborative filtering algorithm;cluster;dimension reduction;local optimization;user privacy","Collaboration;Sparse matrices;Matrix decomposition;Dimensionality reduction;Clustering algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Filtering","collaborative filtering;data privacy;matrix algebra;optimisation;pattern clustering;recommender systems;singular value decomposition","improved collaborative filtering algorithm;user privacy protection;recommendation algorithm;matrix dimension reduction technique;clustering technique;user-item scoring matrix;local optimization;locally optimized SVD technique;recommendation speed;collaborative filtering algorithms;data sparsity;MovieLens dataset;singular value decomposition","","","","14","","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For Karaoke, recommendations of the next songs play a significant role in leading customers to explore more songs and make the most of time in Karaoke. However, few recommendation functions are provided due to the difficulty and uniqueness of the Karaoke environment, in which unknown groups choose songs based on with whom they are sharing the Karaoke experience and the group mood; solid information of these factors is not available. In this paper, we propose a session-based multivariate recurrent neural network (RNN) to consider an occasion for a Karaoke store visit and any possible mood changes; these factors are assumed to be embedded in the sequential data. The model uses metadata from previously played songs, the conditions present, and performs several tasks that predict the songs and artists to be played at time t to t+n. It outperformed the item-kNN algorithm for prediction tasks (offline) of the next song by 127.94% regarding MAP@20 and the next artist by 142.8% regarding MAP@10. In addition, we analyzed the performance of the model for three types of groups, namely individuals, older groups, and younger groups that were manually categorized from played songs, and it outperformed the item-kNN algorithm by 89.59%, 483.11%, and 50.88% regarding MAP@20 respectively. The model also outperformed the baselines for all positions in a session, which demonstrates that it has the potential to quickly capture the preferences of a target group and to recognize mood changes from the sequence. We have launched a recommender system that is designed for Japanese Karaoke stores. The system has demonstrated that the model used in this system is also appliable to business applications due to its ability to handle vast numbers of requests in a reasonable time and enhance user experience by helping to choose more diverse songs faster.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378439","Machine learning;Commercial services","Recurrent neural networks;Mood;Target recognition;Big Data;Solids;User experience;Task analysis","","","","","","18","","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These unwanted information present in the online sites is referred to us the spammers. In the existing work related to the you Tube the user have to search for the videos which takes a long time and irrelevant videos not related to the user search is displayed. The aim of the proposed work is that, User-generated content (UGC) video systems by definition heavily depend on the input of their community of users and their social interactions for video diffusion and opinion sharing. As a UGC system can achieve a larger audience through improved connectivity, findings motivate to propose a mean to enhance the users' connectivity by taking benefit of friend recommendation and spammer detection of the online videos. The algorithm active lazy fuzzy classifier algorithm used to detect spammers. Two similarity metrics are constructed based on users' interests that are derived from their uploads and favorite tagging of videos. Two friend recommendation algorithms are then proposed.

Data analysis shows that users tend to enroll in courses under the same tag group as their previous enrollments. In this work, we research the problem of user tagging employing the user-course-tag heterogeneous network from XuetangX, where the tags are course categories.

After a network of web services is built, such queries are issued once, and answers are found from the scratch. The underlying assumption is that the participating web services are rather static, which means that their functional and non-functional parameters seldom change. However, such an assumption is often baseless. New services come and go, service APIs change gradually, and QoS values fluctuate in practice. Therefore, a support for efficiently adapting service composition is desired. In this paper, we propose an event driven continuous query algorithm to intelligently cope with different types of dynamic services, and thus enable evolution of service composition. Evaluation using both real QoS data and synthetic web service data shows its superior performance, compared with the state-of-the-art solution which won the performance championship of Web Service Challenge in 2009 and 2010. Moreover, we generalize a new graph problem: dynamic single-source optimal-Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) problem based on the above work. It is argued that API recommendation for framework evolution, as another typical application, could also be modeled and addressed efficiently using the proposed new graph approach.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2015.2466544","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7185446","Automatic service composition;evolution;continuous query","Quality of service;Web services;Heuristic algorithms;Indexes;Meteorology;Time factors;Cities and towns","application program interfaces;directed graphs;quality of service;query processing;Web services","QoS values;continuous query algorithm;QoS data;synthetic web service data;service API;service composition;QoS-aware automatic service composition;Web services;dynamic single-source optimal-directed acyclic graphs;DAG problem;API recommendation","","3","","51","","11 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address the challenge, the state-of-the-art algorithms assigned uninteracted items smaller weights of being negative and performed low-rank approximation over a user-item interaction matrix. However, the prior ratings of uninteracted items are usually set to zero but may not well-defined. To avert the prior ratings of uninteracted items, in this paper, we propose a novel ranking-based implicit regularizer by hypothesizing that users preference scores for uninteracted items are close to each other. The regularizer is then used in a ranking-based OCCF framework to penalize large difference of preference scores between uninteracted items. To optimize model parameters in this framework, we develop a scalable alternating least square algorithm and coordinate descent algorithm, whose time complexity is linearly proportional to data size. Finally, we extensively evaluate the proposed algorithms with six real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed regularizer significantly improves recommendation quality of ranking-based OCCF algorithms, such as BPRMF and RankALS. Moreover, the ranking-based framework with the proposed regularizer outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms for implicit feedback.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2021.3069057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9387576","One-class collaborative filtering;implicit regularization;item recommendation;coordinate descent;alternating least square","Optimization;Recommender systems;Collaboration;Time complexity;Computer science;Task analysis;Stochastic processes","","","","","","","IEEE","26 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As user engagement with web videos has grown significantly, understanding user preferences based on videos viewed looks promising. The above requires ability to classify web videos into a set of categories appropriate for the personalization application. However, such categories may be substantially different from common categories like Sports, Music, Comedy, etc. used by video sharing websites, leading to lack of labeled training videos for such categories. In this paper, we study the feasibility and effectiveness of a fully automated framework to obtain training videos to enable classification of web videos to any arbitrary set of categories, as desired by the personalization application. We investigate the desired properties in training data that can lead to high performance of the trained classification models.

At present, one-pass streaming algorithm for counting global and local triangles has been widely studied, and most researches focus on the single-machine streaming algorithm in a 'offline+batch processing' mode. However, researches on distributed online algorithm on multiple machines are still in its infancy, and this stage has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we investigate the triangle counting problem in large-scale simple undirected graphs whose edges arrive as a stream. We propose two distributed online streaming algorithms to estimate the global number of triangles, which are based on the current best performance sampling-based streaming algorithm. We mainly realize the reasonable partition of the graph stream, so that each worker independently estimates the number of triangles in a subgraph of the graph stream. Experimental results show that our algorithms reduce the estimation error and are several times more accurate than state-of-the-art streaming algorithms.","1521-9097","978-1-7281-2583-1","10.1109/ICPADS47876.2019.00049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8975766","Approximate algorithm;distributed streaming algorithm;graph algorithm;graph stream;triangle counting algorithm","","approximation theory;distributed algorithms;graph theory;network theory (graphs)","user portraits;one-pass streaming algorithm;global triangles;local triangles;single-machine streaming algorithm;offline+batch processing;distributed online algorithm;multiple machines;distributed triangle counting algorithms;simple graph stream;local topology structures;social network analysis;recommendation systems;large-scale simple undirected graphs;sampling-based streaming algorithm","","1","","14","","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To meet recommended real-time and fault-tolerance requirements of IMA software architecture, the operating system (OS) should support spatial and temporal partitioning in order to integrate different applications. However, the schedulability test of partition scheduling is undetermined. We regard non-partition scheduling time as a pseudo-task with highest priority and give the schedulability test of partition scheduling based on rate monotonic (RM) algorithm. With the test, the scheduling requirement can be conducted. Through an example, the computing of scheduling parameters is proposed and three cyclic scheduling strategies at the OS level are constructed. The schedulability test can be used to validate the scheduling parameters of temporal partitioning in IMA.","","978-1-4577-1085-8","10.1109/ISCID.2011.183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6079802","avionics software;temporal partitioning;schedulability;rate monotonic algorithm;integrated modular avionics","Processor scheduling;Aerospace electronics;Schedules;Partitioning algorithms;Job shop scheduling;Servers","aerospace computing;avionics;operating systems (computers);scheduling;software architecture","schedulability research;partition scheduling;IMA;integrated modular avionics;cost reduction;fault-tolerance requirements;real-time requirements;software architecture;operating system;OS;rate monotonic;RM","","2","","10","","17 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The incompleteness of massive data in the IoT is widespread. Obtaining personalized information from the incomplete data set is still puzzled by searching efficient and accurate methods at present. Skyline query is a widely used data processing method, especially in the field of multi-objective decision analysis and data visualization. To eliminate the negative effects on massive data processing in IoT, a novel skyline preference query strategy based on massive and the incomplete data set is proposed in this paper. This strategy simply separates and divides massive and incomplete data set into two parts according to dimension importance and executes skyline query, respectively. The strategy mainly resolves the problem of extracting personalized information from massive and incomplete data set and improves the efficiency of skyline query on massive and incomplete data set. First, this paper presents a skyline preference query strategy based on strict clustering and implements it on dimensions that have higher importance. Second, a skyline preference query strategy based on loose clustering is implemented on dimensions that have lower importance. Finally, integrating local skyline query results, this paper calculates global skyline query results by using information entropy theory. The efficiency and effectiveness of Skyline Preference Query (SPQ) algorithm have been evaluated in terms of response time and result set size through the comparative experiments with ISkyline algorithm and sort-based incomplete data skyline algorithm. A large number of simulation results show that the efficiency of SPQ algorithm is higher than that of other common methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2639558","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Key Basic Pre-Research Program of China; Foundation of Science Public Welfare of Liaoning Province in China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7858739","Internet of things;incomplete data processing;skyline query;information entropy","Encoding;Clustering algorithms;Internet of Things;Data processing;Data mining;Information entropy;Cyber-physical systems","data handling;data visualisation;Internet of Things;query processing","incomplete dataset;personalized recommendation;real-time data;Internet of Things;IoT;personalized information;multiobjective decision analysis;data visualization;massive data processing;skyline preference query strategy;global skyline query;information entropy theory;SPQ algorithm;ISkyline algorithm;sort-based incomplete data skyline algorithm","","13","","23","","17 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When sensitive data is shared among multiple users based on cloud storage, it is critical to preserve the anonymity of the data uploader against the auditor. That is, the auditor should not get data uploader’s identity through the data audition. To address this problem, many PDP schemes with user identity privacy-persevering are proposed. However, most proposed schemes are designed based on PKI technique which suffers from big burden of certificate management. Moreover, data auditors in most proposed schemes bear heavy computation cost which results to the lower efficiency of the scheme. To overcome the shortcomings, we present a novel identity-based PDP protocol to audit efficiently the integrity of group shared data with uploader’s privacy-preserving. Due to the inherent structural advantage of identity-based crypto mechanism, our PDP scheme is able to avoid the problem of certificate management. Different from previous works, our scheme ensures the relationship of the data and the data uploader in the phase of proof generation not the phase of integrity audition. Therefore, the data auditor does not know the relationship at all as well as the extract data uploader of the challenged data. At the same time, establishing the relationship by cloud server in proof generation step can reduce the computational cost of data auditor greatly. Furthermore, the relationship of data uploader and challenged data in the proof is randomized so as to strength the security of the scheme. All these efforts are made in our scheme to efficiently realize the anonymity protection of the data uploader. We give the detailed security proof of our scheme under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. Many experiments are performed to evaluate the efficiency of our scheme, the results show that our new scheme is efficient and feasible.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3066497","Program for Scientific Research Foundation for Talented Scholars of Jinling Institute of Technology; Open Research Fund of Key Lab of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Ministry of Education (Personalized music recommendation oriented by multimodal social network big data); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9380750","Cloud secure storage;identity-based cryptography;group data integrity checking;user privacy preserving;efficiency and security","Data privacy;Cloud computing;Protocols;Data integrity;Cryptography;Servers;Privacy","","","","","","42","CCBY","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
